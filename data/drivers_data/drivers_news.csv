While Lando Norris was over the moon to grab a first home victory, Oscar Piastri was left more disgruntled thanks to a mid-race penalty.
||
That 10-second time penalty ended up costing Piastri the win, the time he lost in the pits enough to jump Norris ahead after the Australian had led his team mate for much of the race.
||
While a 1-2 is still a dream result for the team, and extends McLaren’s lead in the Championship to a mighty 238 points, the joy Team Principal Andrea Stella felt was slightly tempered by some frustration on behalf of Piastri.
||
“Both drivers drove very well, pretty much with no issues at all,” said Stella to Sky Sports F1 in the wake of a chaotic race in wet-dry conditions.
||
“Oscar very aggressive at the start, he gained the lead quite deservedly, then the penalty unfortunately meant he couldn’t capitalise on a victory. This went to Lando.
||
“I’m sure for Lando this is a very, very special day, a win at the home Grand Prix. P1, P2 for McLaren so overall a very strong day, we are really happy, it is something we need to celebrate.”
||
“Couldn’t be happier for Lando, couldn’t be happier for the team, but disappointed for Oscar for sure, he drove an unbelievable race,” added McLaren’s CEO Zak Brown.
||
Piastri’s penalty was for braking behind the second Safety Car ahead of the restart, when he was trying to build a gap as the lead car. The stewards deemed him guilty of “erratic” braking and handed him a 10-second time penalty, which cost him the lead.
||
“We certainly gave our input to the Race Direction, especially related to the fact that we felt the Safety Car was called in relatively late,” Stella explained.
||
“This didn’t give much space for the leading driver to take control of the group and go with the restarting procedure. So, we think overall the penalty was harsh… At the moment there is not much we can do, we just need to take it on the chin.
||
“A tough one for Oscar as he drove very well today, very well. But it is just the midseason, many more opportunities and I think this will give Oscar even more motivation.”
||
Brown was in full agreement, saying it looked “worse than it was,” before adding that these kinds of penalties always have “an element of subjectivity.”
||
Norris winning meant he cut into Piastri’s Championship lead – which stood at 22 points just two races ago. Back-to-back victories for Norris has reduced that to just eight points at the midway point in the season.
||
“If we can continue to build a gap, we want it to be up to them to decide who wins the Championship,” added Brown.
||
“If it comes down to the two of them, may the best man win. And they are both very clean drivers, so that is what is cool, you don’t feel like one is going to run one off the track. They’ll fight hard, mistakes will happen along the way, but I think it’s going to be an epic battle down to the final race.”

As for Mercedes, its potential was disguised by a strategic gamble which did not work out and by tyre warm-up issues when running on slicks.

||
Not only did McLaren's Lando Norris take victory for the very first time at his home race, there was also plenty of celebrating for Kick Sauber as Nico Hulkenberg took his first ever F1 podium on his 239th start.
||
With plenty of famous faces turning out to watch all the action, here's our round up of the highlights from a chaotic wet-dry British Grand Prix...
||
Norris headed into the British Grand Prix weekend joking that he would swap all his other trophies for a victory on home soil – and the McLaren driver brilliantly achieved that lifelong ambition in Sunday’s wet and wild encounter.
||
Norris ended Qualifying with a tinge of disappointment, having been outpaced by Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and team mate Oscar Piastri, but the race would belong to the home favourite after all sorts of weather conditions, incidents and drama.
||
That path to victory was aided by Verstappen’s spin as a mid-race Safety Car ended, and Piastri’s 10-second penalty for his approach to the restart – the papaya pair swapping places when that sanction was applied during the final pit stops.
||
While Piastri was left unhappy with the penalty dished out to him for the Safety Car infringement, emotional scenes followed in Parc Ferme when Norris parked up in front of his family and began to process what he had just achieved, with the bonus of cutting Piastri’s championship advantage from 15 points to eight.
||
“The last few laps I was just looking into the crowd,” said Norris after the race. “I was just trying got take it all in, enjoy the moment, because it might never happen again.
||
""I hope it does, but these are memories that I’ll bring with me forever so – an incredible achievement.”
||
Hulkenberg was making his 239th start at Silverstone on Sunday, having arrived on the F1 grid with Williams back in 2010 – his personal best result up to this point behind a fourth-place finish on three occasions.
||
But in addition to Norris’ big day, the German got a breakthrough of his own as he finally stood on the F1 podium after a superb rise from 19th position to third – behind only the aforementioned McLaren drivers.
||
Crucial to the result was Hulkenberg’s ability to keep another home hero in Lewis Hamilton at bay across the second half of the race, with the Kick Sauber proving to be a match for the Ferrari in the challenging, wet/dry conditions.
||
“Obviously I was thinking that Lewis is going to give it all in front of his home crowd and I was like, ‘Sorry guys – it’s also my day!’ I’ve got to stick my neck out,” Hulkenberg said afterwards, before finding some champagne and beginning the celebrations.
||
Wet weather races always cause chaos, and Silverstone this year was no exception. There were incidents galore throughout the 52 laps of the race, with spins, shunts and crashes to go with drivers running wide, choosing the wrong tyres and getting frustrated with the strategists.
||
Verstappen was one of those to crucially spin, the Dutchman doing so at the Safety Car restart that saw Piastri penalised. While he managed to recover to fifth at the flag, not everyone was so lucky. In the end two Safety Car periods were required along with two Virtual Safety Cars to deal with a few stricken vehicles.
||
Liam Lawson crashed out at the start after colliding with Esteban Ocon, who later spun after contact with his team mate. Speaking of the other Haas driver, Ollie Bearman also spun after being hit by Yuki Tsunoda, with the Red Bull driver earning a 10-second penalty of his own for that one.
||
Ferraris' Charles Leclerc took the scenic route across the grass more than once, while George Russell spun into the gravel after popping on the hard tyres a tad optimistically.
||
Lawson’s team mate Isack Hadjar also parked up after rear-ending Kimi Antonelli, who had to retire himself as a result of that shunt. Gabriel Bortoleto retired after knocking off his rear wing spinning into the barriers, but at least that lot saw some racing action.
||
The same couldn’t be said for Franco Colapinto, who stalled in the Alpine pit box before the lights had even gone out – and therefore failed to start the race.
||
The celebrities were out in force at Silverstone, braving the weather to experience a taste of F1 action. For many, this was not their first rodeo – actors Tom Holland and Hannah Waddingham have been here before, as has Keanu Reeves, who will front a new documentary series covering Cadillac’s journey to the F1 grid.
||
Vin Diesel was treated to plenty of fast and furious racing through the rain, with Olivia Wilde also getting another taste of F1 action having starred in Rush a few years ago.
||
Big F1 fan Jeremy Clarkson was in attendance along with his farming guru Kaleb Cooper – who might have found these cars a tad faster than the tractors he normally deals with.
||
Tony Hawk brought his skateboard along, Gordan Ramsey was another keen to watch the action while Jose Mourinho managed to stay dry by presenting the pole position award on Saturday to Verstappen.
||
Finally, Damson Idris hung up his race helmet to watch the action and even got to wave the chequered flag – definitely not a task he handled when starring in F1 The Movie.

TRACK INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by Jenson Button)
||
Q: Nico Hülkenberg, you’re going to be standing on that podium. How does that feel?
||
Nico HÜLKENBERG: Yeah, good! It's been a long time coming, hasn't it? But, yeah, I always knew we have it in us, I had it in me somewhere. So what a race, coming from virtually last, doing it all over again from last weekend. It's pretty surreal, to be honest. Not sure how it all happened, but obviously crazy conditions, mixed conditions. It was a survival fight for a lot of the race. I think we just were really on it. The right calls, the right tyres, at the right moment. Made no mistakes and, yeah, quite incredible.
||
Q: It's been over 200 Grands Prix – quite a few over 200 Grands Prix, but we won't dwell on that. But it must be mentally so difficult going through all those times when it's almost there and then it's taken away from you. Just give us a little bit of emotion of how this feels right now?
||
NH: I mean, today, I think I was in denial until probably the last pit stop, you know, and then when I heard we gapped Lewis quite a bit with the one extra lap, I was like, ‘okay, this is good, this is some breathing space’, but then he was catching quite quickly. So yeah, the pressure was there. It was an intense race, but like I said, we didn't crack. No mistakes. And obviously really, really happy with that.
||
Q: Fantastic. And obviously you had the seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton chasing you down at the end. So, it was like the biggest pressure situation you could possibly have had at the British Grand Prix.
||
NH: Yeah, I was thinking that, you know, obviously he's going to give it all here in front of his home crowd. And I was like, sorry guys, but it's also my day, I’ve got to stick my neck out and, yeah, super happy. Thank you very much for the great energy and support here every year.
||
Q: Congratulations.
||
NH: Thank you.
||
Q: Oscar, I can imagine the emotions very high, and we always say that you're very level-headed, but I've never seen you quite so upset about the situation you find yourself in.
||
Oscar PIASTRI: Yeah, I'm not going say much. I'll get myself in trouble. So well done to Nico. I think that's the highlight of the day. So yeah, I'll leave it there.
||
Q: You obviously had a reasonably good start against Max, made a lovely move, and it looked like you had good pace throughout the race. And it was the one incident that you're not going to want to talk about, but we need to mention it here on the back straight. Obviously, getting the gap to the Safety Car.
||
OP: Yeah, I mean, apparently you can't brake behind the safety car anymore. I mean, I did it for five laps before that. Again, I'm not going say too much till I get myself in trouble. But thanks to the crowd for a great event. Thanks for sticking through the weather. I still like Silverstone even if I don't like it today. So, thanks for coming out, everyone.
||
Q: Lando, wow! You just won your home Grand Prix.
||
Lando NORRIS: Oh, wow. It's beautiful. Everything I dreamed of, I guess. Everything I've ever wanted to achieve. Apart from a championship, I think this is as good as it gets in terms of feelings, in terms of achievement, being proud – all of it. You know, this is where it all started for me, was watching actually, was watching you on TV many years ago. And now, thankfully, I've been able to have my go. So yeah, incredible race. Stressful as always, but the support from the fans made the difference today. So I’ve got to thank them for it all.
||
Q: What's going through your mind in those last couple of laps of the race? What is the feeling? What is the emotion? And are you thinking what am I going to do when I cross that finish line? Or who am I going to wave at? What is it like?
||
LN: Yeah, I mean, your mind just goes pretty blank. So everything you might think before the race, you forget. I mean, the main thing is always just don't ****** it up. That's rule number one. But the last few laps, I was just looking into the crowd. I was just trying to take it all in, enjoy the moment because it might never happen again. Hope it does, but these are memories that I'll bring with me forever. So incredible achievement.
||
Q: Great. I'll apologise for you.
||
LN: Thank you. Sorry. I'm also sorry. But yeah, amazing.
||
Q: And not the easiest way to win your home Grand Prix, with the weather conditions throwing everything at you possible, safety cars. It was a tough one.
||
LN: Yeah, I think in terms of being a stressful race, this is as stressful as you can get. But I mean, it was a good race for Oscar as well. I’ve got to give my credits to Oscar. He was fast the whole way. So yeah, a round of applause for Oscar because he put up a good fight, and I enjoy those moments together when we're on track. Not as much as when he's ahead of me as when he's behind, but that's life. And yeah, so credit to him and of course McLaren. To win at home in front of all the friends and family we have here is pretty amazing. So, a big thanks to them.
||
Q: Yeah, the championship's obviously heating up. It's exciting. You're getting so close to Oscar. I want to leave the last word with you for the fans that come out here to watch you race, and you've won the British Grand Prix for all these fantastic fans out there.
||
LN: Yeah, I mean, it's always hard, right? Because before the race, I'm like, I want to give them something to cheer about. But it's a long 52 laps and you never know what's going to happen, especially when it was raining earlier. So, it's always hard to imagine what it's going to be like. But now I'm feeling it, and it's unbelievable. So yeah, thanks to all the fans, all the British fans, all the McLaren fans. And shout out to my grandstand in the corner because I gave all my credits to them. They were amazing. They cheered me on every lap and it was really a beautiful thing.
||
PRESS CONFERENCE
||
Q: Lando, very well done. You've won your home race. Just describe what this moment means to you.
||
LN: Where do I start? I mean, eventful race. Yeah. Eventful race. I mean, it means a huge amount. You know, at the end of the day, being on top in your home race is very, very special. And I said in some of the other interviews, you know, this is where it all started for me. I was watching on TV. I was watching, all those many years ago, Lewis, Jenson, Fernando. I think it was, you know, that extremely wet race here, in 2007 or 2008. That's when I really started watching Formula 1. And I think Lewis won, and I got that picture of him going around and seeing all the fans standing up, and that picture of what an atmosphere in Silverstone is like, and dreamed of that for many, many years. And today I got to live that feeling myself and see it through my own eyes. So pretty amazing, pretty special. A lot of people, from my friends and family, my brother, my sisters, my mom, my dad, my dad's parents. Every person that I could have here is here. So, yeah, more special than ever, 100%. And, yeah, tough race to do it in as well.
||
Q: You've been ticking off the big races this year, Monaco, now Silverstone. Do you feel you're enjoying a bit of a purple patch at the moment?
||
LN: I mean, it's tough to say it. Look, you can always class it as momentum or whatever, but I don't think that… yeah. I don't know. It’s whatever you want to believe in the end of the day. I think it's still just one race at a time. Obviously, I had a good race last weekend and we had a good battle, and we got close, and I was looking forward to another good battle. So, you know, I give my credit to Oscar at the same time because he drove an extremely good race. But, you know, it’s two wins, but they've not come easy by any means. We've had good fights, but they're pretty strenuous, exhausting weekends because you're fighting for hundredths and thousandths, and you're fighting for perfection every session and I’m against some pretty good drivers. So, it takes a lot out of you, especially when you have a race like today. So, I've had two good weekends and, of course, I would love to continue that momentum, but it still requires more consistency. Two weekends doesn't mean anything otherwise. And I just need to keep it up and keep working hard.
||
Q: It was a very unpredictable race this one. How difficult was it to make the right calls at the right time?
||
LN: I think as a team, we did a very good job. I was pretty happy with everything. I think we made the right calls at the right time. Probably could have boxed for slicks a couple of laps before we did. But, you know, the first part of the race, Oscar and Max were fighting quite a lot, and I was pretty patient. I didn't push too much. I tried to look after my tyres a little bit more for some of the later stages when it started to rain again, but it was probably the wrong thing to do. I probably should've just pushed because we went onto another set of Inters. It's just tough to not crash in these conditions. It sounds so obvious and easy, but the amount of moments you have, at Turn 1, the aquaplaning in 2 , the aquaplaning into 9, where Hadjar crashed – you don't realise how close sometimes we are to crashing and it all being in the bin in a matter of tenths. They are scary moments inside, but then they excite you in a way, and then you open your eyes, you concentrate again. It's scary and thrilling at the same time. But they're also fun races, but they take a lot out of you in one single race. So, a lot of decisions, but I think as a team, we talked through things perfectly well and we kept calm through the whole thing, and that paid dividends at the end.
||
Q: Oscar, let's come to you now. Great job by you. You showed great pace throughout, but the ten-second penalty cost you. Can you talk us through what happened on the rundown to Stowe behind the Safety Car?
||
OP: I hit the brakes. At the same time I did that, the lights on the Safety Car went out, which was also extremely late. And then obviously, I didn't accelerate because I can control the pace from there. And, yeah, you saw the result. I didn't do anything differently to my first restart. I didn't go any slower. I didn't do anything differently. So, a shame.

||
Q: Are you going to talk to the stewards? Are you going to seek clarification about the penalty?
||
OP: I don't know. I don't think it's worth doing at the moment. I'm not sure it's going to be very constructive in all honesty. I don't know. But I don't really care at the moment.
||
Q: You've had frustrations before in your career. How long will it take you to move on from this one?
||
OP: I don't know. It obviously hurts at the moment. It's a different hurt though because I know I deserved a lot more than what I got today. I felt like I drove a really strong race. Ultimately, when you don't get the result you think you deserve, it hurts, especially when it's not in your control.
||
Q: As you say, you drove a very strong race, had really good pace, very aggressive with Max on lap eight to take the lead. Just how much confidence does the drive you put in today give you going forward?
||
OP: A lot. I think it was a really, really good day. A similar race to here 12 months ago and a very different outcome for the whole team. The whole team did a really good job. The car was obviously mega, and giving myself credit, I feel like I did a good job today. So, it just makes it more painful when you don't win.
||
Q: Nico, let's come to you. Very well done. Your first podium. What a moment for you. Just describe how you feel.
||
NH: Happy, but, you know, it's a lot to take in, to process. It's been a very intense race. I think Lando has put it pretty well. It's so intense for us in the car in these changeable conditions on a damp track. You always feel like with one foot you're in the wall when you're exploring and on the limit and then trying to push. So, yeah, very intense. Obviously, it was a kind of a distance battle with Lewis at the end who was making up some ground, but not enough, luckily for us at the end. So, yeah, everything coming together, big relief, very happy, very positive day. From a massive low yesterday being almost last, literally on the grid, to this result is kind of surreal. It's going to take a few days to process everything and take it all in. Good news is we have two weeks now to enjoy it and to celebrate it properly over the next week before we go again.
||
Q: At what point in the race did you realize the podium was on?
||
NH: Before we pitted back onto slicks. I passed Lance, then Lewis passed Lance pretty quickly, and then I was able to keep him at bay and even pull away when the Inters started to wear more and more. So I was like, that was looking pretty positive and encouraging. Then I think we made a really good call by stopping one lap later than he did for the slicks, and we gained I think around ten seconds. That gap was crucial. From there onwards, felt like a pretty long ten, 11, 12 laps, whatever it was. But from there onwards, I knew we have every chance to get this result. We just needed to keep it on the road while pushing.
||
Q: How much more is possible with this car? You've scored points in the last four races. The team has outscored Red Bull at the last four races. Just how much more can you do?
||
NH: You want even more? Jesus! I think that's pretty good for starters today. If we had a dry race, it would have been a very different day and outcome for us. Whilst we've made some really good improvements since Barcelona, today is obviously circumstantial, and the conditions made this race and this result possible. But I feel in the midfield fight we've definitely gained some momentum, and we are a serious competitor there. That's where our fight is, but it's always about maximizing every race, every weekend, and just trying to do well.
||
QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR
||
Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Nico, congratulations. It's been ten years since you last stood on a podium, back at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Obviously, this one very different. But just the sort of feelings and emotions you've had even the past half an hour, an hour or so, spraying the champagne, celebrating with these guys, how has that felt doing that again after so long?
||
NH: Felt good. I still remembered how to do it. Used to do it a lot in the junior stuff and then had to wait for it quite a bit. But it just happened so quick, the race, and you're still processing that. Then so many emotions, so many people coming at you, a lot of positivity, a lot of congratulations. At the moment just happy, relieved. But like I said, it's going to sink in more over the next few hours and the next few days, and I think I'll feel the enjoyment even more in the week to come.
||
Q: (Leonid Kliuev – Grande Premio Brazil) Question for Oscar. Does it feel a bit inconsistent, the penalty in comparison to Canada?
||
OP: I don't know how different it was. I can only comment on what I felt I did, which I felt was well within the rules, and I did it once already in that race. So, yeah. I don't really get it. I'll go have a look back.
||
OP: I also have a question for Nico. How does it feel after fifteen years of F1 to get a podium [trophy] that's made out of Lego that you can just pull apart?
||
NH: What? Sorry.
||
OP: It's just made out of Lego that you can pull apart and probably buy next week.
||
NH: Yeah. I love Lego! It's good. My daughter can play with it too. You’ve always got to see the bright side. But, you know, a bit of silver or gold would have been nice too, but I won't complain.
||
Q: (Christian Menath – Motorsport-magazin.com) Congratulations, Nico. Two questions for you. At the beginning of the race, you pitted quite early for intermediates. Was that some kind of undercut? And later on, you were behind Lance for quite a bit of time. Did you feel you were losing the podium chance there?
||
NH: It's true. We pitted from inters to inters. Obviously, it was drying out. The inter was wearing down, the first set from the start, but the team said there’s some rain about. It actually changed within one or two laps from a pretty bright sky to dark clouds and I was just dropping back. I was really struggling with that first set. They said the rain is coming, so I just dived into the pits, to be honest, without thinking too much at the time and then went out and the rain started. It was really good timing. All the stops we made today, they could not have been better. We pitted at the perfect time every single time, which is very rare and difficult to do. But it's just how it happened today, and we really hit that one on the head. Behind Lance, he was quick. We had very similar pace, but then on that set of Intermediates, he eventually was just degging off a bit more than me when the track dried out. So, it just took a while to find a way through. But I wasn't even really thinking about the podium there. We were running P5, I think P4 at the time, so it was already pretty good. I was just about keeping it going and making no mistakes.
||
Q: (Phil Duncan – PA) A question for you, Lando. You sounded very emotional in the cockpit when you crossed the line. Was it fair to say there might have been a few tears perhaps when you finished? What emotions were going through your mind in the last lap and when you crossed the line?
||
LN: No. No tears. I tried, but no. I don't know. When I get emotional, I don't cry, I just smile. It's pure happiness. It's pure enjoyment of the moment that you're in. I wish I could cry because I think it looks better for pictures sometimes. But no, I just smile instead. Like I said before, this is where it all started for me, seeing this, having all my grandstands here, and even before the race just thinking like, someone's got to win today. I probably have a better chance than most. There's no reason why it can't be me. I always find it at times hard to picture and be too positive prior to races and never say today is going to be my day. But I was actually surprisingly hopeful this morning that today I could do well, and I had the pace when I needed it. I've joined a long list of pretty incredible winners who have won here in the past. Most of them are Lewis! But to join him and, from a British side, to continue the reign of the British here is pretty amazing. And just for the fans. The last two laps, looking up at the fans and seeing them on their feet and cheering – these are moments that no one really gets, none of you guys get to witness. This is something that I and very few others, especially Brits, get to witness. It's a very selfish moment, but it's one of the most special, the most incredible, because it's such a rare thing that someone gets to feel and to see and to witness. For me, the best win. Maybe not the best way to win, I'm not going say it's my best win, that's not true. But in terms of what it means to win here at home, the want, the desire to do it in front of my own grandstand, my family, my friends, McLaren, His Royal Highness is here, to win in front of all of them and to make amends for last year makes it all even more special. So, yep, very memorable.
||
Q: (Jack Smith – motorsportweek.com) Lando, congratulations. I just wanted to ask you a little bit about the new front suspension on the car. How much confidence does that give you now, given that you've taken two wins with it and there's still half a season to go? It must be a good feeling.
||
LN: You sound more positive than I still am. Yeah. It could be worse. It could have made it… people talk about it probably too much. That's just my honest opinion. It could be that it's helping me, and when I say helping, it’s helping me by hundredths, thousandths, I don't know. It's impossible to numerically put a number on it. Like I said in previous interviews, it's something the team believed might give me more feeling, and I just roll with that. I believe. My faith in the team and my belief in them thinking this might help. Not a guarantee, but it might. And that's it. Yes, I won two races since. I was real quick in Canada. I'm not going to say it's down to that, obviously. I want to put more of it down to my hard work, my work I've been doing away from the track, with my team, with many people that I have around me. I put it way more down to that than some alterations on the suspension. At the same time, I could just say I think I could have achieved the same thing without it and just going back to our previous spec. So, I don't know. Hopefully, one day we get to back-to-back test it and I might get a feeling, I might not. My feelings have been good over the last few races, but I think more of that's come from just my working on trying to get better feelings and maximizing lack of feelings in certain areas more than it has been by so many improvements from a car point of view. But we've improved the car. We've had upgrades last weekend, things like that, and that helps. We won by what, 30 seconds here. We won by 20 seconds last weekend, so the car's pretty damn good. I want to put it more down to my hard work rather than that, but it's a combination of both.
||
Q: (Fred Ferret –  l’Equipe) Question to Oscar. After serving the penalty, what did you ask to the team? Was it to reverse position? And to Nico have you thought of the German Grand Prix in the rain, when the podium was possible?
||
OP: Yeah. I thought I would ask the question. I knew what the answer was going to be before I asked. But I just wanted a small glimmer of hope that maybe I could get it back. But no, I knew it wasn't going to happen.
||
NH: Yeah. I mean, it's… I thought about it. But today is better.
||
Q: (Emily Selleck – Motorsport.com) Question for Oscar. Are you happy with how the team handled that request? And considering this is maybe the most dejected we've ever seen you, does this feel at all like a turning point in how you're approaching this championship fight?
||
OP: I don't think there's anything wrong with it. Lando didn't do anything wrong. I don't think it would have been particularly fair to have swapped, but I thought I'd at least ask. It doesn't change much for the championship. I feel like I did a good job today. I did what I needed to. That's all I need, and I will use the frustration to make sure I win some more races later.
||
Q: (Edd Straw – The Race) Oscar, the stewards' decision mentioned that Max had to take evasive action to avoid a collision. Obviously, you've got lots of experience of Safety Car restarts. Do you recognise that fact, or do you think it was just within the bounds of what you have to be ready to do to react when you're in that queue?
||
OP: I don't think he had to evade me. I think he managed the first time. Going back to Canada, I think you had to evade more there than you did today. So, yeah, I'm a bit confused to say the least.

['oscar-piastri'],['Oscar Piastri'],‘I didn’t get the result I deserved’ – Piastri rues penalty after P2 at Silverstone,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/i-didnt-get-the-result-i-deserved-piastri-rues-penalty-after-p2-at.4guFDPTBqf1YCQVqHC2XT6,"Oscar Piastri voiced his unhappiness at the 10-second time penalty he received during the British Grand Prix, the Australian ending the race in second after earlier leading.","Oscar Piastri has rued the impact of a “pretty bad” 10-second time penalty on his race at the British Grand Prix, with the McLaren driver feeling that he did not get the result he “deserved”.
||
After starting from P2, Piastri had got himself into the lead of what proved to be a highly eventful wet-dry race at Silverstone, holding onto that position through two Safety Car periods.
||
However, when the second phase came to an end, Piastri was deemed by the stewards to have braked too late at the restart, resulting in him being handed a 10-second penalty which he later served during a pit stop.
||
This dropped the Australian down to second, while team mate Lando Norris took victory and brought Piastri’s championship lead down to just eight points. Nico Hulkenberg, meanwhile, claimed a debut F1 podium in third.
||
During his initial post-race interview, Piastri was reluctant to comment on what happened as he said: “I’m not going to say much, I’ll get myself in trouble. Well done to Nico – I think that’s the highlight of the day. I’ll leave it there.""
||
He added: “Apparently you can’t brake behind the Safety Car anymore. I did it for five laps before that and, again, I’m not going to say too much because I’ll get myself in trouble.
||
“But thanks to the crowd for a great event, thanks for sticking through the weather. I still like Silverstone even if I don’t like it today. Thanks for coming out everyone.”
||
When speaking to media later on, the 24-year-old gave a further insight into his feelings about what had happened.
||
“I thought the penalty was pretty bad but, anyway, I’m glad we had a quick car today, showed what I needed to prove, and it’s just disappointing when what you deserve gets taken from you, but that’s how it goes,” said Piastri.
||
“I hit the brakes, saw the Safety Car lights went off so I didn’t accelerate again, and Max [Verstappen] went past me which was a bit strange, and then I got a penalty for it so about as simple as that.”
||
Pushed on what he would take from the weekend as a whole, Piastri responded: “The pace was good, I did everything I needed to, just didn’t get the result I deserved.”

PARC FERMÉ INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by Jolyon Palmer)
||
Q: Lando Norris, home race, third on the grid but it’s such fine margins out there today?
||
Lando NORRIS: Yes, good qualifying and you know I’m not going to be unhappy with third. Of course I’d love to be on top here in Silverstone, but Max did a good job, not quick enough for us today. But still, a fun qualifying. Qualifying here at Silverstone is pretty fast and it’s enjoytable and good fun. Yeah, not the top but still a good day.
||
Q: I can only imagine it must have been hard to put laps together with the speed of these corners, the windy conditions, trying to find tiny margins all the time. What are you focusing on to nail the perfect lap?
||
Lando NORRIS: Little things today. Little things today, put you ahead of behind. Like, you saw how close Q1 was, which was pretty shocking, and I guess good at the same time. But yeah, little margins, little mistakes, little things. You’re talking a couple of hundredths here and there can win or lose you the game today. So tough, especially with the wind and the conditions. A little bit of rain every now and then. But still, all good fun and still happy with the third.
||
Q: You were third last year, you had a chance to win the Grand Prix on the Sunday. Surely there's a chance coming tomorrow. Fifteen thousandths behind Oscar, you have Max in the fight as well. You've had some great battles with those two in the past, what are we thinking?
||
LN: I think it’s going to be fun tomorrow. I think it’s going to be a good battle between the three of us. Probably more, you know, with Lewis, with Charles behind, with George as well. It’s going to be an interesting Sunday, so I’m looking forward to it.
||
Q: Oscar, second, you were provisional pole after the first runs there of Q3 but couldn’t quite keep it there on the second run. Are you happy with your lap there?
||
Oscar PIASTRI: I was happy with the first lap. The first time was mega, to be honest. I was trying to think of how I was going to go faster and I didn’t. So yeah, the last lap was a little bit messy, but it’s been tight all weekend. I think the first time was very good. I don’t know how much the track would have improved, but a little bit on the table, whatever it was, it wasn’t enough. The team’s done a great job. We’ve tried a lot of things this weekend, trying to get a bit more pace. The car’s felt mega all weekend, but there’s been a few points where we were scratching our heads as to why we’re not quicker. So yeah, the team doing a great job getting us back onto the form that we know. It’ll be an exciting race tomorrow.
||
Q: Alright, take us under the helmet then. You’ve got provisional pole, you wheel back into the garage, you’ve got more than a tenth margin at this point as well. You said you didn’t know how you were going to find more time. You’re hoping that others aren’t, obviously. But the track’s evolving and somehow you’ve got to go back out there and wind it up. How tricky is that?
||
OP: Yeah, it’s tough. Especially when you think it’s a good lap, you don’t want to overdo it and try and go over the limit. I think it was a couple of corners where maybe I was a bit safe on the way in and tried to make up for it on the way out and it didn’t quite work. So yeah, always little bits, it’s fine margins as we know, but ultimately pretty happy with second on the grid. So, I’m looking forward to a fun race.
||
Q: And as well, you’ve had some great fights with Lando in the last race. It was a pleasure to watch. You’ve had some good scraps with Max. You’re going to start with them tomorrow. Can you get elbows out?
||
OP: Yeah, I think so. It’s going to be a fun race. You know, it’s been very evenly matched between Max, the Ferraris, I saw even George being up there at the end. So I think it’s going to be a pretty evenly paced race tomorrow, and all of have us got slightly different strengths. Red Bull is very quick in a straight line, we’re going to be quick in the high speed. So yeah, it’s going to be a fun one. That’s all. We’re going to enjoy it.
||
Q: Max Verstappen, what a lap there at the end. You just pinged them all in, all the sectors. How did you do it?
||
Max VERSTAPPEN: It was tricky out there with the wind, through the whole qualifying Q1, Q2, Q3. It was all shifting around a bit. Yeah, a bit different. And around here with these cars, it’s extremely sensitive to it. So yeah, just trying to tidy it up throughout the whole qualifying and that final lap was good enough. But you know, I mean, this is a proper track, in qualifying when you have to go flat out in all these corners. It’s really, really committed and that’s really enjoyable.
||
Q: You say the last lap was good enough. It looked pretty unbelievable from when I was watching it. You’ve also got a trimmed out car on downforce, a choice that you made overnight. I was thinking this is a set-up choice with the race in mind, but you’ve nailed it on pole for qualifying already.
||
MV: Yeah, exactly. We’re quite quick on the straight, which of course is not that easy in the high speed corners to manage. But we did today, luckily. Of course, we have to wait and see what tomorrow will do, if there’s a bit of rain around and all. But I’m happy, of course, with our qualifying. It’s a big boost for the team as well. Just excited to go racing now tomorrow.
||
Q: And you’ve had some great battles with those McLaren drivers already this season. You’re starting ahead of them. You’ve had some fantastic wins already this year. You have the race pace tomorrow. Do you need to keep them behind?
||
MV: Difficult to say, but we’ll try. Now we’re going to go racing, we’re going to have fun, and we’re going to try to do the best we can.
||
PRESS CONFERENCE
||
Q: Many congratulations, Max. What a final lap from you. Just how good was it?
||
MV: Pretty good. I mean, it was not easy out there to produce a consistent lap time just because of the wind, the gusts as well that you got out there. The car was moving around a lot even just on straights, so sometimes a bit unpredictable in places because of it. But luckily, that last lap came together quite nicely. Just had to commit a lot in the high speed with this low downforce that we have on the car, which we just tried to build up on. Luckily in Q3, that worked out.
||
Q: You were fourth after those first runs of Q3. Just where did you find the time on that last lap?
||
MV: Everywhere except the last sector. So, every single corner, a little bit. My first lap, I don't know, it just felt really different to Q2. Just more oversteer, more understeer in places, and that then made the lap not amazing. But I never thought that I could find whatever it was, almost four tenths, I think. So yeah, it worked, so I'm happy with that.
||
Q: Max, it's been a bit of a recurring theme at Red Bull this year. Unhappy on Friday, big changes overnight, and you guys get it together for Saturday. Just how different does the car feel today compared to yesterday?
||
MV: In some places, quite different. Yesterday, I was just understeering a lot but at the same time also having oversteer in places. It was very difficult to balance. I think today, we definitely improved the understeer and that just allowed me to push a bit more because understeer is slow, especially in F1. So, we just needed to try and minimise that.
||
Q: So, let's look ahead to tomorrow. You have good straight-line speed, we saw that today. Just how confident are you in the long run pace of the car?
||
MV: Yeah. I mean, let's see. We’ll just go in there and try to do the best we can. Normally in the race runs, we struggle a bit more on tyre life. I don't know how that will be tomorrow. We have to wait and see a little bit also how the weather will be in general, if there is some rain or not. The straight-line speed is nice to have but you still need to manage the tyres around here. It's very tough with all these high-speed corners. But I'm just looking forward to it. I'm not really in a battle, so I’ll just try to have fun and try to get the best possible result.
||
Q: Oscar, let's come to you now. You were fastest after those first runs of Q3. At the time, did you think it was going to be good enough for pole?
||
OP: It was a good lap. I was very happy with it, but I kind of felt like every run, the track was improving a bit. So, I felt like I probably needed a bit more, which was correct. The second lap was a bit scruffy, couple of moments that caught me a bit by surprise. I mean, I always hate blaming wind, but I need to see if it was the wind. But also, maybe trying a bit too hard in a couple of places as well to make up for it. Overall, pretty happy. It's been tight all weekend, especially through qualifying, so P2 is not a bad result.
||
Q: Oscar, as you say, it is very tight. Just two tenths of a second separating the top five in qualifying. Have you been surprised by just how close it is?
||
OP: Not necessarily. For me, what's the biggest surprise is how each car is generating their lap time. You look at the speed traces and they all look completely different, but they end up basically at the same point at the end of the lap. So that's been quite interesting to get our heads around. I'm not that surprised that Max is quick here. It's quite similar to Suzuka, similar conditions to Suzuka. Clearly, they found some pace from yesterday. I think the big surprise was Ferrari yesterday, and even this morning. So not a huge surprise that it was so tight. Maybe how many teams were involved was a surprise, but it's been tight in nine out of ten qualifyings this year.

||
Q: Interesting that you reference Suzuka. Do you think we'll see more overtaking tomorrow here at Silverstone than we did in the Japanese Grand Prix?
||
OP: I hope so, because there wasn't a whole lot in Japan. Let's see. I think the tyres will be a bit more interesting than they were in Japan potentially, and also with the different strengths of different cars that we'll see which seems to be the better compromise tomorrow. I hope so. If it's good for one overtake, then I'd be pretty happy. But let's wait and see.
||
Q: Lando, let's come to you now. Great job as well. It's incredibly close at the front. Just how smooth was the session for you, first of all?
||
Lando NORRIS: Reasonably smooth. As smooth as I could probably ask for. Most of my laps were all pretty decent. Q1 was the only little nervous one just with how close it was from the front to last really. Otherwise, all good. Most laps always improved and found good lap time. Probably just my final one, would have hoped to find just that little bit more. Just didn't quite get the grip out of it in some corners, and the right balance, but I'm still happy with the third.
||
Q: Pirelli have gone one step softer with the tyres this year. Just how much of a factor do you think that's going to be in the race?
||
LN: Certainly it can be a factor. It was very warm yesterday comparing to today and then comparing to what it's going to be tomorrow. There's also some rain expected for tomorrow, so let's wait and see. I think it could still be a difference in strategies. Like Oscar said, every car gets lap time quite differently. We probably seem a little bit more in the middle of both a Red Bull and a Ferrari, but I think it can easily make a lot of opportunity come everyone's way tomorrow. So probably expecting a tough, but an exciting race.
||
QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR
||
Q: (Tim Hauraney – TSN) Question for Max. Max, congratulations. This looked like a heck of a lap. You did touch on this a little bit, but I was wondering if you could just provide a little more context to it. Starting a weekend off difficult, the evolution of the race car itself, how much work actually goes into that over the weekend to get the car to sort of come to you?
||
MV: Sometimes more than other weekends. I think it just caught us out yesterday. We had that much understeer in the car, which we didn't expect to happen. So, then you need to work around with the tools that you have. Luckily, we went into the right direction with it.
||
Q: (Erwin Jaeggi – Motorsport.com) Question for Max. How much did the updated floor contribute to today's performance and does today's performance make you more optimistic for the rest of the season?
||
MV: I'm not sure how much it did, but for sure it brought something. I'm happy with any kind of upgrade that we get on the car. We just keep learning, keep trying to be better, and take it race by race what we can do.
||
Q: (Andrew Benson – BBC Sport) Max, could you explain the thinking behind the choice of the low downforce setup given the various compromises to do with straight line speed, raceability, tyre wear, wet weather, etc?
||
MV: We looked a bit slow yesterday on the other wing. Plus, I was just understeering to the moon. So, I had to try and reduce a bit that understeer, and it seemed to work. It is light on downforce for sure. You can see that, I guess. But it seemed to hold on and that's why we decided to stick with it. We'll see what we get from it tomorrow in the race.
||
Q: (Simon Abberley – Nevis Radio) Question yet again for Max. Obviously, the grid's looking quite tight. You've got Oscar beside you, Charles Leclerc a few spaces back, three very hungry Brits. Are you going to  be doing a race tomorrow looking forward, or will you be doing a race defending more?
||
MV: Well, I guess naturally, I have everyone behind so I have to look behind me and see what will happen. But for sure, I can see a proper battle. Even in the long runs, there were a lot of cars that were quick. Even in qualifying, it was all quite tight. Like Oscar said, quite different lap time gains – some quick on the straight, some quick in the corners – and I think it's just going to depend on who can keep their tyres alive in the stint.
||
Q: (Alex Kalinauckas – The Athletic) Question to Max, please. Couple of your pole positions this year have come at real drivers’ tracks, in terms of Suzuka early on in the season and then here today at Silverstone. I just wondered, do the two compare in your mind in terms of the challenge of getting things wrong when at such high-speed corners and such fine margins?
||
MV: Well, I think it's natural. Tracks that I just enjoy more. I don't like street circuits in general. I just like the high speeds, where you have to be committed. It's more flowing. That's really where an F1 car comes alive. Naturally, of course, the car has to work with you, right? We know that on this kind of track the car just comes alive a bit more. But as you could see yesterday, we were also struggling a lot with our balance. So, we had to fix that as well to be able to do what we did today.
||
Q: (Fred Ferret – l’Equipe) Question for Oscar and Lando. Do you think that the rear wing of the Red Bull will help you or make the work tougher to overtake Max?
||
OP: It's hard to know at the moment. I think, for us, what's been impressive is some of the high-speed performance that they can continue with, even with the light downforce. So, let's wait and see tomorrow. Of course, I hope that the higher downforce works a bit better in a few areas, but honestly, we really won't know until tomorrow. It's also been interesting with other teams, it's not always just been the higher the downforce you have the quicker you are in all the corners. Some of the corners we’re still slower than the Red Bull and Max. So, it's not that straightforward, but I think it's going to be an interesting thing to see tomorrow.
||
LN: It's hard, honestly, to know until you get behind and you have the dirty air and DRS and things like that. To be honest, at the minute, our DRS speed probably just about matches Max's speed. So, I think it'll be tough because we’ll probably catch him in the high speed, but we just won't really close much when we open the DRS. I think it can be tough, but there's also probably more opportunities than a normal race. Like they both said, between everyone, we're fast and slow in different places. You look at Red Bull Ring and you say Red Bull Ring is high-speed, but comparing to Silverstone, it's quite medium-speed. Here is definitely high-speed, and it's probably highlighted a few more of our weaknesses. We've performed very well in the slower and medium-speed tracks, some of the higher speed, we’re not bad, but we always seem to lose out to Max and the Red Bull, like Oscar said, in Japan, here, things like that. So, yeah, clearly things to work on. But I think we go into the race tomorrow, there's still plenty of opportunity for us.
||
Q: (Edd Straw – The Race) One for Max. Although you've got a good result today, obviously some of the same problems there, car limitations, getting caught out by the car not doing what's expected on Friday. How frustrated are you by the overall rate of progress that even though you can get results like this, it's not possible as regularly as you'd like?
||
MV: Naturally, I think if you look at our season so far, we haven't performed the way we wanted to. But that's how it is. I cannot change that. We are pushing all flat out, myself, the whole team, to try and be more competitive. Some tracks naturally are a bit better for us, unfortunately. The calendar is not all like this, so we need to try and also improve in other areas. It's not that straightforward. Otherwise, of course, we would have done so already. But at least I'm happy with today. It's a good boost for everyone, also after last weekend, which I think we were lacking a bit of pace, but also we were a bit unlucky in general.
||
Q: Jack Smith (Motorsportweek.com) Question for Lando. If it does rain tomorrow, do you think it will be a fight between yourself and the two men next to you, or do you think that it will be much more open with the Ferraris and maybe even the Mercedes in there as well?
||
LN: I expect everyone, probably more so the Ferraris because they're the highest downforce of the lot. Their high-speed performance is pretty impressive and a good step better than ours even. So, I would probably more likely say Ferrari, but I just wouldn't rule out the Mercedes as well. I think they're quick. George is always there in those kind of races where there are a lot of opportunities and unpredictable weather, things like that. So, opportunity for everyone, but I think the Ferraris are the ones who have been very quick since FP1. Very quick in high speed, and that normally always helps in the rain.
||
Q: (Erwin Jaeggi – Motorsport.com) Question for Lando. In 2021, a 14-year-old Arvid Lindblad told you “remember me, I’ll see you in five years.” You shared the track on Friday. What's your impression of him? Have you spoken with him? And for Max, Arvid has been labelled the new Max Verstappen. What's your impression of him, and how helpful was his feedback?
||
LN: I spoke to him once, I think. Once or twice. Twice including five years ago. But I remember that day, the day I launched my go-kart, and I literally remember the moment he said that to me. It makes me feel old, probably for one of the first times in my life, which is not a good thing. But yeah, cool to see. Always nice to see the new guys coming through and doing well. He has done well in the previous categories, and Formula 2 is always a tough one. So I'm sure he'll keep fighting and probably be in Formula 1 in a few years.
||
MV: From my side, he raced for my best friend's go-kart team, so I already had a bit of information on him, and he's great. He's very fast and he just needs to do it step by step. I think the way that Red Bull also is preparing him is good. He just needs to do his thing. Being labelled as the next Max, he should just be himself. That's what you need to focus on. I think that's also what he knows how to do. He has good people around him that are like a mentor to him. So, yep, step by step. I'm happy for him. He's doing well. Let's see what happens when he eventually can get into F1.

"['oscar-piastri', 'lando-norris']","['Oscar Piastri', 'Lando Norris']",McLaren 'scratching our heads' at lack of pace as Piastri and Norris miss out on British GP pole,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/mclaren-scratching-our-heads-at-lack-of-pace-as-piastri-and-norris-miss-out.59GNii8CfQ0CnrVBXSNuBA,"McLaren has ""been scratching our heads"", according to Oscar Piastri, after its pace advantage from Austria has not carried over to the British Grand Prix.","Oscar Piastri admits that McLaren have ""been scratching our heads"" over a lack of pace as both he and team mate Lando Norris were beaten to pole position for the British Grand Prix by Max Verstappen.
||
Piastri enters the race at Silverstone this weekend 15 points clear of Norris in the Drivers' Championship, the McLaren duo having dominated last time out in Austria, and 61 points ahead of Verstappen approaching the halfway point of the season.
||
But that pace advantage from the Red Bull Ring has been missing so far this weekend in Britain as cooler conditions have allowed Verstappen, as well Ferrari drivers Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc, to close the gap.
||
""The team has done a great job, we've tried a lot of things this weekend, trying to get a bit more pace,"" said Piastri post-Qualifying.
||
""The car has felt mega all weekend but there's been a few points where we've been scratching our heads why we're not quicker.""
||
Piastri sat on provisional pole position after the first set of runs in Q3 on Saturday but ultimately failed to improve with his final effort, which allowed Verstappen to snatch top spot by just 0.103s with his last lap.
||
The Australian admitted that it was hard to find additional time with his second effort having felt the first attempt was near the limit.
||
""The first lap was mega to be honest,"" said Piastri. ""I was trying to think how I was going to go faster and I didn't.
||
""The last lap was a little bit messy but it's been tight all weekend. I think the first lap was very good, I don't know how much the track would have improved but a little bit on the table, we'll never know if it was enough.""
||
Norris finished just 0.015s behind his team mate but will start from the second row on Sunday with a maiden home win in his sights having claimed victory a week ago in Austria.
||
The Briton, who believes ""little margins, little mistakes"" proved the difference as drivers battled with changeable wind conditions through the high-speed turns, stated that a number of drivers will be in genuine contention during the race.
||
""I think it's going to be fun tomorrow. I think it's going to be a good battle between the three of us,"" he said.
||
""Probably more with Lewis [Hamilton] and Charles [Leclerc], George [Russell], as well [in sixth for Mercedes]. It's going to be an interesting Sunday so I'm looking forward to it.""

||
Norris produced a time of 1m 25.816s with Pirelli’s soft compound tyre in FP2 at Silverstone, putting him 0.222s up on Charles Leclerc and 0.301s up on Lewis Hamilton in the two Ferraris, who caught the eye throughout the day.
||
While satisfied with his and McLaren’s start to the weekend, Norris took notice of the pace displayed by Ferrari and expects a stern challenge from the Scuderia in the battle for pole position and victory.
||
Asked about his pace-setting effort, Norris said: “I mean, the soft was a very strong lap. But me being me, I think also just in general, the Ferraris have been very, very quick today – and they shall be tomorrow.
||
“I think we have a bit of work to do, to be honest. It looked maybe a bit too good today. Like always, Ferrari catch up into FP3, like they did last weekend [in Austria]. I would say pleased with today, but nothing to be too proud about just yet.”
||
Nonetheless, Norris’ aim heading into Saturday is clear, as the home favourite looks to deliver pole position in front of his own bright yellow grandstand, saying: “That’s my target! I’m working on it.
||
“I would look at it [the stand] every lap, every single lap. I mean, it’s hard to miss! Every lap I’m forced to look at it, but it’s also just a great thing to see. If it’s distracting me, it’s distracting others, so it’s working perfectly!”
||
Meanwhile, championship leader Oscar Piastri finished the day 0.470s down on team mate Norris – the Australian also talking up Ferrari’s speed and predicting “a lot of competition” for the big prizes.
||
“A good first day, I think,” Piastri reflected. “Ferrari have looked very competitive. I think we looked alright. In FP2, the soft tyre was a little bit messy for me. I think the potential’s definitely there and the long runs looked pretty solid as well.”
||
Asked if he was surprised by Ferrari’s showing, he said: “It was a bit of a surprise, yes. They looked good. Both in the Qualifying runs and the longer runs as well, so I think they’re in the fight this weekend, which is interesting to see.”
||
He added: “I think if I can piece things together it’ll be very competitive. [It was] just not a great lap and with these tyres around here you pretty much get one shot, so my second attempt was pretty decent considering the tyres. I’m pretty relaxed.”

||
A race-long scrap played out between the pair last time out in Austria, in which Norris fended off the challenge from Piastri to claim his third win of the season. Piastri, however, still leads the championship standings by a margin of 15 points.
||
When asked if he was ready for another battle with Norris this weekend at his team mate’s home track, Piastri smiled: “Let’s wait and see. I think it’s going to be an interesting weekend – Silverstone always is. The weather’s always a factor and it looks like it will be again this weekend.
||
“Let’s wait and see, I don’t think it will just be two McLarens this time. I think Mercedes will probably be quick, Red Bull honestly you never really know but they’ve been quick here in the past, Ferrari as well looked to be a little bit stronger in Austria, so let’s see.
||
“It’s a track I always enjoy, and I’m expecting it to be a good fight with whoever it is.”
||
A sequence has emerged during the campaign so far in which, whenever Norris has won a race, Piastri has proven victorious at the following Grand Prix.
||
In terms of whether that might be on his mind during the weekend ahead, the 24-year-old answered: “I have found the same pattern as you, but there’s nothing conscious about it. I think it’s just been coincidence.
||
“I always go into every weekend, just trying to do the best that I can. I felt like maybe in China there was a bit of extra motivation but more because of how painful Melbourne was, more than anything else.
||
“I just go into every weekend trying to do my best, go in with the best state of mind that I can and I think I’m always learning things about myself, about how I need the car as well, and [I’m] learning lessons all the time.”
||
And given the psychological element at play in the championship fight, Piastri was also quizzed on how important it would be to beat Norris at the Briton’s home track.
||
“I don’t really think so,” the seven-time race winner said. “Every driver wants to win their home race, but at the end of the day it’s only worth the same amount of points as everywhere else. Monaco is kind of a similar feeling but, yes, would I love to win this weekend? Of course.
||
“So let’s see what happens. It’s a track I enjoy, a track I’ve had good success at in the past, so hopefully can be a good weekend.”

||
It was a two-horse race for the win at the Red Bull Ring once Piastri made his way past Ferrari's Charles Leclerc at the start of the Grand Prix, the Australian then harrying and pushing polesitter Norris on in the first stint.
||
In a thrilling exchange in the early stages Norris was unable to break the DRS, and was vulnerable for lap after lap to his team mate, something that will have heightened the heart rates on the McLaren pit wall given the duo's collision in the Canadian Grand Prix.
||
As the fight for the lead went on Piastri did manage to briefly overtake for first place, only to see Norris cut straight back past. Then came arguably the championship leader’s best opportunity as he out-braked Norris into Turn 4 – only to lock up, and narrowly avoid contact.
||
McLaren pitted Norris soon after, and then their strategies diverged – Piastri staying out before emerging from his own pit stop six seconds adrift of his team mate later on, with McLaren then able to enjoy a slightly less fraught race.
||
Piastri never got back into DRS for the remainder of the Grand Prix, with Norris going on to win his third race of the season.
||
“It was intense racing, but that is what we are here for, to race,” Stella explained.
||
“It was an open race today and here in Austria it is a special track as, when you get the DRS, you stay hooked to the car ahead and this is what happened in the first stint, as the pace between Lando and Oscar was very similar.
||
“So, this is what happened, they stayed together throughout the stint and Oscar had a couple of chances. We are very happy and proud of how they handled the situation.
||
“We needed to give Oscar a bit of advice in terms of the manoeuvre in Turn 4, which he once again acknowledged. So, I’m proud of him for how he said straight after the chequered flag that he was sorry for that manoeuvre, he went a little too far. It’s not easy, it is Formula 1, he is racing, he is racing hard but it is a good day.”
||
Piastri remains in the lead of the Championship, but Norris has closed the gap down to just 15 points following his Spielberg triumph. With Max Verstappen failing to finish, the McLaren pair have a commanding lead over the rest in what is shaping up to be a straight intra-team fight for the title.
||
“They are obviously stressful moments, but we trust, we rely on Oscar and Lando and also once we are on the pit wall you just try and stay as chilled as possible and analyse rationally what is going on,” Stella added, reflecting on the pairs on-track battles.
||
“But for us, it was clear that the guys needed to have the opportunity to give the race, both, as long as they do it in the way they have done it today. It is a great spectacle for Formula 1.
||
""We are happy that we entertain our fans, our spectators and we look forward to more races like this even if, yes, it gave us some nervousness on the pit wall. But that is what we are here for.”
||
Following McLaren's 1-2 result in Austria, the Woking-based squad have an even more commanding lead in the Teams’ Championship, 207 points ahead of Ferrari.

||
Lando Norris bounced back from his Canada crash to seal victory, coming out on top after another nail-biting scrap with McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri – while, behind them, Red Bull endured a nightmare outing at their home event, Gabriel Bortoleto broke his points duck and several famous faces watched on. Here's our round up of all the highlights from the Austrian Grand Prix weekend...
||
A badly judged overtake attempt last time out in Canada saw Norris and Piastri clash, with the former retiring from the race while Piastri’s eight-race streak of podium finishes also came to an end.
||
The pair reset for another round at the Red Bull Ring, with Norris clearly meaning business as he established a comprehensive gap over his team mate in Qualifying, but Piastri was far from fazed, declaring he was “not planning on finishing third”.
||
He quickly followed through on his words at lights out, charging past Charles Leclerc and immediately launching a challenge on Norris for the lead of the race. In possibly one of the most thrilling intra-team battles of the last few years, the two engaged in a race-long fight that involved each side of the McLaren garage going head-to-head, bringing strategy and tyre management into the on-track contest.
||
Norris had the clear advantage of starting on pole position, but Piastri rapidly shut down the gap and pursued the Briton with DRS for the entirety of the first stint.
||
In a moment that surely saw the team pit wall hold their breath, Piastri darted past Norris on Lap 11, snatching the lead albeit for only a short time. The original leader remained by his side and prevented him from edging further ahead, reclaiming first place as quickly as he’d lost it.
||
The tension didn’t end there as the Australian endured another heart-in-mouth move soon afterwards – closing in on Norris once again, he locked up just behind and came agonisingly close to colliding with the rear of his car, but fortunately only emerged with an uncomfortable flat spot.
||
With the first round of pit stops beginning to kick off, the pair never got quite as near each other on track again, as Piastri’s choice to stay out for four laps longer than Norris led to a six-second gap between them. A seemingly endless stream of backmarkers, including Franco Colapinto who forced Piastri off onto the grass unaware he was behind, further halted the Australian’s ambition to return into DRS range, and Norris was able to endure the constant pressure until the chequered flag fell.
||
Looking at past results, this weekend should have been a return to glory for the Milton Keynes-based outfit – Max Verstappen holds the most pole positions and most victories in Austria and, of course, the circuit itself bears Red Bull’s name in the team’s home country.
||
Hordes of people rocked up in orange for the occasion, ready for another Verstappen masterclass in the Styrian hills. But they were swiftly disappointed by the conclusion of Qualifying as the Dutchman ended up in P7, deterred from setting a second flying lap due to the yellow flags shown whilst Pierre Gasly recovered from a late spin.
||
The session was similarly, if not more, disastrous for Yuki Tsunoda, who failed to progress to Q2 for the second time in the last three rounds and was resigned to start the race from P18 on the grid.
||
While Verstappen labelled the result “painful”, he also admitted that there could be “some surprises in the race”, which certainly proved to be accurate. Maybe he was expecting some drama at the front that he could capitalise on, but the drama actually ended up involving him.
||
Just a few corners into the opening lap, Kimi Antonelli locked up his rear tyres and found himself unable to make the corner, instead plunging straight on into the lead Red Bull to take both himself and Verstappen out of the race.
||
His remorse was evident as the two were seen talking whilst their cars were recovered, and the rookie confirmed that he had apologised immediately after the incident that caused the reigning World Champion’s first DNF since the 2024 Australian Grand Prix. Antonelli still received a three-place grid drop for the upcoming round at Silverstone for causing a collision.
||
Tsunoda was forced to take on the role of the sole remaining Red Bull, but little went well for him. On Lap 30, he was passed by Colapinto’s Alpine and, determined to reclaim the position, he threw caution to the wind and ended up clipping the Argentine’s right rear tyre to send him into a spin.
||
He then headed to the pits to replace his damaged front wing and dropped to last in the order, with things going from bad to worse as he was handed a 10-second time penalty for the collision, well and truly confirming his P16 result.
||
Amid a wealth of collisions and mechanical failures, it’s nice that at least one driver experienced the best weekend of their F1 career so far – enter Kick Sauber’s Gabriel Bortoleto.
||
The combination of returning to a circuit he performed superbly at in his junior career and finding the rhythm he has been searching for in the C45 came together to produce the rookie’s first F1 points.
||
After making it into Q3 for the first time this season, Bortoleto raced those around him masterfully, including his manager/mentor Fernando Alonso – the two engaged in a heartwarming battle for P7 in the final laps of the Grand Prix, with the former World Champion clinging onto the position.
||
He was later seen hugging the Brazilian and congratulating him on defending his Qualifying position to finish in eighth place, just ahead of his team mate Nico Hulkenberg.
||
Aside from Alonso, another driver to make the one-stop strategy work was Liam Lawson, who achieved his best Qualifying result so far (P6), in a similar vein to Bortoleto. He started and finished as the lead Red Bull-backed racer, securing an important six points for Racing Bulls as he escaped up the road from the Alonso-Bortoleto battle on the penultimate lap.
||
Saturday’s Qualifying was an exciting affair, with Norris grabbing pole for Mclaren. Having sat out FP1, Norris topped FP2, FP3, Q1 and Q2 – so it was no surprise when he grabbed the P1 grid slot.
||
What was a surprise was the margin, the biggest of the season so far at 0.521s. That is a mighty gap at any circuit, but at Austria where the track is one of the shortest of the calendar, it laid down a form marker that Norris is back in business.
||
Yes, there was the caveat that a few drivers including Piastri did not get to complete – or even start – their second runs in Q3 thanks to yellow flags, but even so, Norris looked untouchable over one-lap.
||
It was the perfect response to some Q3 mistakes earlier this season, and his race-ending collision with his team mate in Canada.
||
News broke on Sunday that Austria has been handed a contract extension and will be on the calendar until 2041. It is a firm favourite with fans and drivers alike, and one of the most picturesque tracks the F1 circus visits.
||
Plenty of stars wanted to judge that for themselves, with Liverpool’s former manager Jurgen Klopp attending the race on Sunday. He spent time in the Racing Bulls garage and perhaps that was what inspired such a strong performance from the team, with Liam Lawson grabbing a brilliant sixth-place finish.
||
Eric Bana was also spotted in the Austria paddock, the actor no stranger to the world of F1 as a big sports fan.
||
It remains to be seen if Pierre Gasly approached him for tips – after F1 The Movie star Brad Pitt cited Gasly as the driver most likely to make it in Hollywood, Gasly joked he might have to turn to acting as a second career unless he started scoring points.
||
And what did he fail to do in the race? Score points. Hollywood might beckon for Pierre.
||

Jurgen Klopp looked to be enjoying the action as he watched on with Racing Bulls' Peter Bayer

TRACK INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by Davide Valsecchi)
||
Q: Lando, what a race. What enormous pressure. How did you handle it? From outside, that was just epic.
||
Lando NORRIS: Yeah, it was a tough race. You know, pushing the whole way through. Tricky, hot, tiring. But the perfect result for us as a team, a one-two is exactly what we want, and we did it again. So, I'm very happy. Probably the best comeback after Canada.
||
Q: What a turnaround. How did you handle Oscar Piastri in the first 20 laps? At a certain point when he overtook you just up there in Turn 3, you had a great battle.
||
LN: We had a great battle, that's for sure. Yeah, it was a lot of fun for me. A lot of stress, but a lot of fun. Yes, a nice battle. So well done to Oscar. Hopefully, it was a nice one for everyone to watch. But inside the car it was tough, especially when he was in the DRS. The DRS is so big around here, it's hard to get him out of the gap. But once I did, I could manage things pretty well. But yeah, he was still quick. So, it was good fun.
||
Q: Congratulations. It was a great show.
||
LN: Thank you.
||
Q: Oscar, congratulations. How was it drom inside the car because it was impressive how you could pressure for all the first 20 laps. It was just something unbelievable. How was it from inside?
||
Oscar PIASTRI: Intense. I hope it was good watching because it was pretty hard work from the car. So yeah, I tried my absolute best and probably could have done a better job when I just got ahead momentarily, but yep, it was a good battle. A bit on the edge at times and probably pushed the limits a bit far. But yeah, it was a good race. You know, that's what we're here to do, try and race each other and then try and fight for wins, and that's what we did today. It was close for me but not quite enough. So, thanks to the team. To have the kind of pace we did whilst battling each other was very impressive. So, I can't thank the team enough for the car we've got.
||
Q: After yesterday and your Friday, did you expect to be so competitive, to fight Lando all through the entire race?
||
OP: Yeah, I mean, I thought it was possible. I think qualifying yesterday was unfortunate with the yellow flag, and then I felt like the pace this weekend has been good. So, I think once I could stay in the DRS, I felt pretty good. Afterwards, once I dropped out after the first stop, it was tough to make the progress to get back. But yeah, some things to go over, see if we could have done anything better.
||
Q: Congratulations. Lovely show.
||
OP: Thank you.
||
Q: Charles, tell me your feeling after you're back on the podium. I think at the beginning you wanted to fight for victory, but then the pace was there. What do you think? How do you rate your weekend?
||
Charles LECLERC: I rate our weekend as a team really well. But unfortunately, the pace today was just not enough. In the first corner I was thinking about going, but Lando closed the door, and then that left the door open to Oscar. I lost second place there. But anyway, I think they were too fast for us to stay in second, so third was the best we could do. I don't regret much of what we've done today. I think we've done our maximum, just not enough pace.
||
Q: Tell me about your Ferrari. The move at Turn 3 was good because behind there was contact. Probably it was better to stay calm in that corner. And about your Ferrari, seems that during the weekend you improved a bit, then in the race, in the first part, you were closer. What's your feeling inside the car?
||
CL: Yeah, in the first stint I think I over pushed a little bit at the beginning trying to follow them, then I degraded a little bit more. But it's part of the game. I’ve tried, at the end, and it didn't make it today. I think eventually we need more pace. We've brought some upgrades this weekend and they definitely helped us to do a step forward, but we need to keep pushing in that direction in order to close the gap to the McLaren that for now are too quick.
||
Q: About the next races, because we are missing a victory this year. Tell me about the next races.
||
CL: I'm missing it too. So, I'll give it all to try and be back on the top step of the podium. Obviously, this is our main priority. The whole team deserves it, and hopefully it will be at the next race in Silverstone. We’ll give it all.
||
PRESS CONFERENCE
||
Q: Congratulations, Lando. It was a thrilling victory for you today. What was the most pleasing aspect of it for you?
||
LN: Crossing the line at the end! That was the best bit, but there was plenty of fun along the way, with Oscar, in the first stint especially. Some close moments, some good battles. Just a lot of laps of looking in my mirrors out of Turn 1 and all the way down to Turn 3. Stressful for sure, not the most comfortable position to be in, but it was a good battle between us. And then quite a long race from that point onwards because I never had a lovely gap, and Oscar kept coming at me the next two stints. So, yeah, good fun, but a tricky race, but well managed.
||
Q: This was the first time that we've seen you and Oscar going wheel to wheel for a prolonged period. Did you learn anything new about him today?
||
LN: No. I mean, we just had some good battles, and we've had a couple in the past. Granted, they probably didn't last as long as they did today, but no, I think we both knew what to expect from each other. We both want to race hard and race fair. It goes both ways, and of course, kind of have to put Montreal behind us and behind me for sure. It's something I wish never happened, but it was nice that we could go out and have a good battle and push things to the limits. There were still some close moments, but nothing that would make Andrea or the pit wall sweat too much.
||
Q: The pace today, Lando, was frenetic. You were twenty seconds ahead of Charles in third place. Were you pushing hard in all three stints?
||
LN: Yeah! Especially stint one. I think we got, like, ten laps here, and the gap was already, like, five seconds. And I knew what our pit stop window was going to be or was planning to be. And I was like, there's no chance we're going make it to the pit stop here. Oscar was pushing too, and I think we knew quite quickly that we weren't racing the Ferraris behind with a quick race car, and it was kind of eyes forward. But the first stint was difficult just because I couldn't get my battery up, and it was quite a strategic part of the race. And I was just always vulnerable for those reasons. But as soon as I did the pit stop, I could get the battery back up for the first time, and then I could be a little bit more comfortable.
||
Q: This is a great springboard for you ahead of your home race at Silverstone next weekend. Are you expecting the updated parts on the McLaren to perform strongly through Silverstone's fast sweeps?
||
LN: I mean, our strengths here were the high speed, so I want to hope it's a similar case next weekend, but it's still a very different track. It's a different layout. We're not going to take anything for granted. But the upgrades were working as they should have done today, and that's certainly a good sign. So I think we give a lot of credit to everyone back in MTC and to the whole team for giving us another very, very good car, upgrades that we just can put on – they've been a little while and we've been pushing with things – but we put them on the car, and they worked as they should. So we're satisfied. The team is satisfied and excited for next weekend. The best race weekend of the year, in my opinion. To have my own grandstand, to have the British fans for McLaren and for myself is something I'm looking forward to for sure.
||
Q: Alright. And very well done today. Thank you, Lando. Oscar, let's come to you now. Can we start by talking about that battle with Lando, what you learned about him, how close it was?
||
OP: I mean, again, there have been a few battles in the past, not just last week, but last year and the year before. So, I think we both knew what to expect. It was a tough battle. It was close at some points, probably pushing the limits a bit much from my side once or twice. But we're fighting for race wins in Formula 1. It's going to be pretty tough work and pretty hard. I thought it was an entertaining race. After the first stop, maybe we didn't do the right thing giving Lando some breathing room, but the first 20 laps were pretty intense. So, it was a good battle.
||
Q: Why did you pit four laps later than Lando?
||
OP: I knew that I was always going to be pitting second in that scenario. For me, it felt like if I couldn't stay within DRS, then getting back inside one second was going to be very, very tough. So, I kind of wanted to go a bit different and give myself some fresher tyres and hopefully be able to use them at the end of the stint. It didn't really pan out that way, unfortunately, but that was the thinking at least. We'll go back and look and see whether that was the right thing to do. In the moment, I was always going to lose some amount of time by pitting a lap later, so I kind of went, why not try something a bit different?

||
Q: It was a great battle with Lando. Just how crucial was it for you to pass Charles on the run to turn one?
||
OP: Yeah. It made a big difference. It meant I could stay in DRS from the start, and DRS is very powerful here. So that certainly helped in the battle at the start. That was an important moment of the race, and then it pretty quickly became clear that it was just going to be a fight between us two. That was a key moment.
||
Q: It was a fight between you two here. Given what you now know about the car, do you think it'll be a two-horse race at Silverstone next weekend as well?
||
OP: I hope so, but you never know. Canada, we kind of thought we'd be good there, and we weren't. Here, we expected to be good, but probably not as good as we have been. I think we should be confident that we'll be decent, I think that's fair to say. But how quick we are, we'll find out next week.
||
Q: Alright. Oscar, very well done to you as well. Thank you. Charles, let’s come to you. Your third podium in four races. What were the key moments for you this afternoon?

CL: Oh, I did not expect that question. There weren't very many key moments on my side. Obviously, the start, I wish I had done a bit of a better job to be completely alongside Lando. Maybe that would have changed a little bit for three or four laps. I don't think we had the pace to stay there in front. Basically, from Turn 1 one to the end, it was a very boring race. I was on my own, just trying to manage quite a few issues that we had on our side. Let's not call them issues, but we've got to do some management in the situation we're in at the moment. I won't go into the detail, but the lift and coast was a little bit frustrating. We paid a bit of the price for it on the first stint, but then the second and last stint were a bit more positive, which was good. But there weren't many key moments apart from the start.
||
Q: Having put a race distance on the upgrades this weekend, are you confident that they are a good step forward?
||
CL: They are definitely a step forward. Yes. And I think it helped us to be on the podium today. The team has done an incredible job at pushing to try and get them as early as possible. I know that they are still pushing extremely hard to have other upgrades as soon as possible, which I hope will make another difference and will help us to be a bit closer to McLaren, to Red Bull in their good days, or to Mercedes even in their good days. So, yeah, we are pushing hard, and I hope that we see the result as soon as possible.
||
Q: Are you surprised by the pace of McLaren this afternoon?
||
CL: Surprise is probably not the right word. The first stint was poor on our side, but the second and last stint I thought were reasonable, but I've got to look. I mean, I was obviously focused on my race, and I didn't see all the lap times. I saw the gap at the end of the race, and it's not the gap that you would want to see, but that's unfortunately the gap that we've had, if not more, since the beginning of the season. For us, we are working a little bit in relative to the others. And for now, this weekend, it's a step forward, and I hope that we can do another one as soon as possible.
||
QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR
||
Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Lando, you mentioned Canada and wanting to put that behind you. How perfect a response has this whole weekend felt? Because you've been P1 every single session. And to soak all the pressure that Oscar put you under, does it feel like you've maybe not proved a point, but to yourself even just to bounce back like this?
||
LN: I mean, it's certainly, yeah, it's fulfilling for me. It gives me good confidence. I don't need to prove any points or prove anything to anyone, honestly. I like to prove things to myself, probably more than anything. So certainly, it's been a good clean weekend from FP2 onwards. Felt very comfortable and very on top of the car and performed exactly as I want to and as I need to. I just had a clean weekend. That's what I had. It's not that I've not been able to do it before and the pace has always been there at certain points. It's just there's been some different reasons for different things. But certainly, coming in today and yesterday to do the job that I did, I'm pretty happy with. But it doesn't come easily. It doesn't come just because I've turned up this weekend and things are better. I'm working a lot. I'm doing a lot more work than I used to away from the track with the team, on the simulator, with my own team, trying to improve everything that I can, both on and off the track. I think it's more a positive thing to see a lot of those things paying off immediately. Good step in the right direction. Still need more, so want more. So, we'll keep working.
||
Q: (Leonid Kliuev – Grande Premio Brazil). Question for Oscar. Do you think the team should have insisted on pitting you right after Lando and give you a chance to win?
||
OP: I don't know yet. We'll go back and look through it. Like I said before, I think I was always going to lose time by pitting second. I had past experience of being just stuck outside DRS, and that was a pretty painful place to be in the past. So, I didn't really want to be there again. In the moment, I thought that giving myself a bit more work to do but with better tyres was going to be an interesting option. With hindsight, yeah, maybe you can say it wasn't the right call, but there's a lot of things you can say in hindsight.
||
Q: (Lawrence Edmondson – ESPN) Another question for Oscar. The team described that move at Turn 4 as “too marginal” over the team radio. Sorry if you've already gone through this, but what was your interpretation of that? And Andrea said you apologised as soon as you crossed the line or at least acknowledged as soon as you crossed the line that perhaps it was a step too far in aggression.
||
OP: Yeah. I mean, I thought it was a fair comment. Locking up and missing the back of your team-mate by not a lot is certainly pushing the boundaries. Even if I hadn't been told anything, I didn't think it was a wise decision to try that one again. So, yeah, a fair comment and nothing more than that.
||
Q: (Zsolt Godina – F1Vilag.hu) Charles, on Friday, you seemed to struggle quite a bit with the pace, but for Saturday your pace improved quite a lot. Was that the result of some setup changes or what happened?
||
CL: Yeah. We changed quite a lot of things on the car. Obviously, I missed FP1, so FP2 was all about trying to understand where we were. Then for FP3, we did a big change in order to re-centre ourselves. I think we did a really good job from Friday to Saturday, only with one session to be able to re-centre ourselves. As soon as I got into the car in FP3, the car was feeling a lot better. I didn't do the long runs with the setup of today, but there weren't any bad surprises as well. I think we did a good job by maximising the car potential this weekend.
||
Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Another one for Lando. You talk about those improvements and that work you've been doing. You and Will were having quite a lot of chatter through the race, and you were asking quite openly, like, look, I need help in some of these corners. Is that part of that extra work you've been doing? Because it does seem that you guys are not talking more on the radio, but at least more about those sort of granular details in terms of where can I find more pace in particular corners?
||
LN: It's part of it. Probably not the precise stuff that I've been working on, but that's just part of the general improvements we've been trying to make. I think it was more normal improvements that I've been trying to make. Just things you need when you're trying to win a race. As much as I like to not have any radio and just do my own thing and concentrate, when you've got some quick guys behind you or ahead of you, there's nothing wrong with asking for a bit of guidance and a bit of help every now and then. I'm just trying to utilise the guys I've got around me. My engineers, my performance engineers, they're looking at a lot more data than I can see. Obviously, I'm the one in the car, but when you've got a guy catching you here and there and there are some corners where you can improve, then I want to know those things. I would say that's nothing more than just general improvements but also me trying to be a bit more accepting of some help sometimes.
||
Q: (Phil Duncan – PA) Lando, you spoke about Silverstone there and your own grandstand and the 140,000 fans. Does that bring any extra pressure? Are you ready to use that to your advantage to get a second win in as many weeks? And to Oscar, obviously Silverstone is Lando's home turf. You two guys are leading the world championship. Are you braced at all for an uneasy or perhaps hostile reception from the British fans?
||
LN: I mean, I certainly hope that part's not going to happen. The British fans are normally very accepting for all of us and especially for us as McLaren. So I think the first point should be for all the fans to embrace everyone and to support everyone. Certainly, for me, I don't think there's any more pressure. Of course, it's a place I want to win more than anywhere else, but it doesn't change anything. It just puts a bit more of a smile on my face every morning when I wake up. It probably distracts me in a good way more than anything. Now I've got my own grandstand, and I've got more reasoning for different things. More of a positive distraction, I would say, more than a pressure. There's pressure in every race. There's pressure to win today, to be on pole yesterday. I don't think I can put myself under any more pressure. That doesn't change anything. More just something to look forward to, to enjoy every day, enjoy every lap, enjoy the experience, because it's still for me an experience to have my own grandstand, to have so many of my fans there supporting me, cheering me on. Very excited for it. Kind of want to go there now, but I could do with a good sleep as well.
||
OP: I don't think so. A couple of years ago they were chanting my name in the crowd, so that was unexpected. I'm not sure I'll quite get that again, which is fair enough. I feel like the fans in general this year have been a bit nicer to us. We didn't even have Max Verstappen fans booing us today, so that was a nice change. They've always been very accepting of me. Obviously, I race for a British team, and I think they're big fans of everything papaya and that includes both of us. I'm expecting there to be a lot more Lando fans than me fans, but that's fair. It's his home race as well, so I think it'll be fine.
||
Q: (Axelle Valliére –  MotorsInside.com) Question for all three. During the race, we still saw a lot of times cancelled because of track limits. However, this morning we know now the track will be on the calendar for many years. So, what do you think? Maybe the track is not adapted for actual F1?
||
LN: I'm very surprised that there were track limits. Maybe Turn 3. Where? I think we just went off track. When we made a mistake, we locked up. The thing is we get a penalty for making a mistake. You get a warning for making a mistake.
||
Q: (Axelle Valliére –  MotorsInside.com) There were no penalties today, but there were a lot of times cancelled. Is it a problem?
||
LN: No.
||
CL: I don't think it's a problem anymore. I think the changes that have been made to the track are actually pretty good to stop the problem that there was before. So, yeah, it's not a problem. Actually, I think it shouldn’t anyway be a discussion. I don't know if anybody took a penalty today, but I feel like it's already a big penalty enough, as Lando was saying. It's enough of a penalty to go off now on a track like this. I don't think it's a problem.
||
LN: Yeah. I agree. They've got the gravel in the main corners where if you go off, you're going to gain time, and you can't gain time anymore. I went off, and I lost a lot of time. We just get the warnings now, but only when we lock up and go off. Same as me last year. I got a five-second penalty for trying to overtake, trying to race in a race. Makes sense. But those things, I think it's a bit stupid. But no, I think this track's a lot better than a couple years ago. It was like 200 off tracks. Now it's, I think, no penalties.

||
After the McLaren pair came to blows last time out in Canada, there were plenty of tense moments as Piastri continuously fought to take the race lead at the Red Bull Ring. Frustrated after a badly timed yellow flag in Qualifying, he was eager to get back to the front as soon as possible.
||
He started from P3 on the grid but did not stay there for long, capitalising on Charles Leclerc’s failed challenge on Norris at lights out to sweep past the Ferrari and launch the prolonged attack on his team mate.
||
The Australian crept closer and closer until he momentarily snatched the lead on Lap 11, making the most of a small error Norris made at Turn 1. However, the Briton stayed close and the two went side-by-side through Turn 4, ending with him reclaiming first place.
||
Following the eventful race Piastri summarised that the battle was “intense”, adding: “I hope it was good watching because it was pretty hard work from the car! I tried my absolute best.
||
“I probably could have done a better job when I just got ahead momentarily, but it was a good battle. A bit on the edge at times and probably pushed the limits a bit far, but it was a good race.”
||
One of those 'on edge' moments came on Lap 20 when Piastri locked up in the middle of an overtake attempt, coming remarkably close to making contact with the rear of Norris’ car. The two kept it clean and the latter peeled off into the pits, while Piastri opted to stay out for another four laps.
||
He hoped to use the advantage of having fresher tyres later on in the race, but a slow stop meant he returned onto the track six seconds adrift of Norris. Even once he cut the gap down, the challenge of passing numerous backmarkers prevented him from getting back into DRS range.
||
Despite missing out on the win, Piastri was pleased with the outcome and said: “That’s what we’re here to do, try and race each other and try and fight for wins. That’s what we did today, it was close for me but not quite enough.
||
“Thanks to the team – to have the kind of pace that we did whilst battling each other, it was very impressive so I can’t thank the team enough for the car we’ve got.”
||
Asked to elaborate on whether he expected to engage in a race-long battle, he added: “Yeah, I thought it was possible. I think Qualifying yesterday was unfortunate with the yellow flag. I feel like the pace this weekend has been good.
||
“I think once I could stay in the DRS it felt pretty good, afterwards once I dropped out after the first stop it was tough to make the progress to get back. Some things to go over and see if we could have done anything better.”

PARC FERMÉ INTERVIEWS
||
(Conducted by David Coulthard)
||
Q: Lando Norris, what a lap on a circuit where we expect it to be super tight. Half a second! Put us in the cockpit – where did that come from?
||
Lando NORRIS: Oh, it was a good lap, that’s for sure. I guess just little bit by little bit. I feel even like my Q3 run one was good, but I knew there’s a few places where if I just got it right, I could get still quite a bit more time. And I did exactly that. So, I did what I planned to do. And when I plan to do something and it goes right, it normally goes very, very well. So yeah, very happy. A good day. It’s been a good weekend for me so far, so hopefully we can keep it up.
||
Q: So, you didn’t do the first practice session, you’ve been top of the times every time you’ve done a lap around this track. I feel that I’m a little bit more impressed and excited by that lap than you are. Is this just a new, steely focus for this weekend?
||
LN: I don’t know. I mean, I’m still very happy. It’s just a long season. I still savour with this moment, especially because this has been some of my tougher moments in qualifying. So, to put in a lap like today, to have the performance throughout this weekend like I had, was pleasing for myself. But I’m excited. It’s a long race tomorrow. I’m very happy with today, but I want to prove it to myself over and over again, and hopefully this is just the beginning of it.
||
Q: Okay. Well, congratulations. I think that was an awesome lap.
||
LN: Thank you so much. Cheers, everyone. Thank you.
||
Q: Charles, after what was an average qualifying in Canada, here we are right there, front row, second place. You must be very happy.
||
Charles LECLERC: Yeah, I’m very pleased. I mean, it’s been a long time since… I think it was Monaco the last time we started on the front row, and it’s been a difficult season overall, but the team have kept pushing. We brought some new parts this weekend, which for sure made a difference because if you look at the gaps, everybody’s super close. So, it’s also thanks to the team, but I’m very happy with the lap. Overall, yeah, it’s a good start to the weekend. We know that we have a better car normally in the race than we do in qualifying, so I hope that we can put a bit more pressure on McLaren tomorrow.
||
Q: Well, you’re obviously happy with that performance. You’re right there with all your other competitors, but a half a second gap to Lando. Can you imagine that lap?
||
CL: I mean, not with our car yet, but we are going to work towards that. But it’s not to minimise Lando’s job, obviously. I mean, he must have done an incredible lap. I haven’t seen it because I just got out the car, but I’ll definitely look at it. Congrats to him. He deserves it. And tomorrow we’ll try and bring him a tough time.
||
Q: Congratulations on second place.
||
CL: Thank you.
||
Q: Now, Oscar, you’re a man that doesn’t really show his emotions. But when I saw you get out of the car, I sensed a sort of disappointment in your walk. Was there something on that lap that you didn’t manage to pull together, or is it just the size of the gap to Lando that’s a disappointment?
||
Oscar PIASTRI: It was the fact I didn’t get to start it. That was the problem. I had Gasly spin at the last corner, so I didn’t even open my second lap. And Lando’s been very quick all weekend, so it would have been a tough challenge, but I think we easily had enough pace in the car this weekend to be on the front row. So always a shame when you don’t even get the chance, but we can still have a good race from there. Sometimes it’s just not your day.
||
Q: Well, long game of course, the race, that’s where the points are. Good position to start. DRS is very effective here as we’ve seen in the other formulas, so still an opportunity tomorrow.
||
OP: Yeah, definitely. I think our pace this weekend has looked very strong. I think the Ferrari pace looked good as well, which was a bit of a surprise, but I think we still got some opportunities tomorrow. So, I’m not planning on finishing third, that’s for sure.
||
PRESS CONFERENCE
||
Q: What a session, Lando. Great job by you. Just how close to a perfect lap of the Red Bull Ring was that last lap of Q3?
||
LN: Always impossible to say, but as close as I would probably ask for. You know, in all the places I could be close to being in the gravel or over the limit, I feel like I was. So, it was a very good lap. I think I improved in every corner and, especially around here, with the high speed in Turn 6, Turn 7, 9, and 10, especially in quali, you’ve got to commit, and it's exciting and nerve-racking at the same time. So, yeah, again, rewarding when things go right like they did today. And to put the laps in that I did today, I was very happy with. So, yeah, it was a fun qualifying.
||
Q: And after going fastest on your first run in Q3, were you able to approach that final lap slightly differently? A bit more relaxed maybe.
||
LN: Not really. No. I mean, the others were not far behind. Even the Ferraris and Charles was a bit closer. I think all the way through quali, actually, the gap to some of the others was bigger than I was expecting. They were not miles away in FP3. But then as soon as we went out for quali, we seemed like a good step ahead. So, I wasn't too worried, but there's this guy here on the left, he's also pretty quick, and the expectation is for him to go out and put some good laps in too, especially in Q3s normally. So, yeah, I think the pressure was still there, and I still knew there were places to improve. So, again, just try to do Turn 1, 3, 4 correctly and then push it a little bit more in the high speed, and that's what I did.
||
Q: Lando, you've had a couple of tricky qualifying sessions in recent races. Just how satisfying is this pole given what's gone before?
||
LN: I mean, it's very satisfying, but, again, it's about consistency. Everyone can be a hero in one weekend. It's progress. It's steps forward. I'm very happy with today, but it's still a long journey. It's a long season. The job I needed to do today, I did. And it doesn't make up for the last few weekends or anything, but I did it today, and that's what mattered. So, yeah, very satisfied and happy for putting it together when I needed to.
||
Q: And you've been quick throughout practice. Just how much confidence does that give you ahead of the race?
||
LN: I think a good amount. I'm starting in the best position. But we've been good since the first laps I did in FP2. We've been competitive, and I've been feeling confident and comfortable in the car. We've had some upgrades on the car this weekend, which is our first proper set of upgrades for the whole season. So, we've waited a good amount of time to apply them, and from what I see today, it looks like it's definitely moved us in the right direction – especially on a circuit where there's only eight corners really. So, yeah, I'm confident we can still have a good race tomorrow, but it's a long one and plenty of things can happen.
||
Q: Charles, let's come to you now. Great job as well. You're on the front row. What does this one mean?
||
CL: It's nice. It's been a long time. I think this year overall, we've been quite weak in qualifying and then pretty strong in the race, but it's good to be at least this time starting from the front row. At least we have a little bit less road to make before fighting with the guys in front. We're there. However, obviously, the gap is pretty big to Lando's lap, which must have been very special for sure. But I don't know if we've got the tools to fight for a victory tomorrow. However, as I said, we are normally very strong on Sunday compared to the qualifying pace, and this gives me hope.
||
Q: You're running some upgrades here. What difference have they made over one lap?
||
CL: Well, enough to be P2 because the gaps are very tight around here if you take off Lando. So it definitely helped us. I felt like there were some steps forward. How much, we need to see it in different characteristics of tracks. It's not only on this track that we've got to judge that, but over multiple tracks. However, the numbers that we expected, we had them, which is a good start. That means that we are working in the right direction.
||
Q: Still a long way to go, but do you think you can challenge for the win tomorrow? Is that realistic?
||
CL: I'll do everything to put more pressure than usual on those two guys. We have Oscar behind with a little bit of luck today, but tomorrow, try and look forward and see what's possible.

SPIELBERG, AUSTRIA - JUNE 28: Pole position qualifier Lando Norris of Great Britain and McLaren and Second placed qualifier Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Scuderia Ferrari talk in parc ferme during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Austria at Red Bull Ring on June 28, 2025 in Spielberg, Austria. (Photo by Joe Portlock/Getty Images)
||
Q: Oscar, let's come to you now. A case of what might have been for you?
||
OP: Yeah, to an extent. I think through all of qualifying, I was missing that last tenth, but not getting the chance to do my final Q3 run was quite frustrating. Sometimes those things are going to happen. I was quite happy that I didn't lose more spots by not doing that. So, third's still an okay place to start around here. You can race around this track, so try and make some progress.
||
Q: I mean, Lando's clearly been very hooked up from the moment he drove in FP2. How comfortable have you been in the McLaren?
||
OP: Pretty comfortable. FP1 was a little bit of a messy start, but then I felt pretty good through the rest of practice. And qualifying again felt quite good. It's very difficult around here to get that perfect lap because there's a lot of corners that have gravel on the exit, and you’ve got to be pretty careful there. But there's also a lot of corners that you miss an apex by five centimetres one way or the other, and you've lost a couple of tenths easily. So it's not the easiest track to hook up even though it's short, and I just kind of felt like I didn't quite do that today. So, a bit of a shame.
||
Q: Can we also get your thoughts on the upgraded parts that you're running here? Do you feel the team has taken a step forward with them?
||
OP: It doesn't feel that different in the car, but on the timing sheets, it looks good. So that's all we ask for. I think the pace this weekend has looked very strong. So, hopefully, that translates to tomorrow as well.
||
QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR
||
Q: (Scott Mitchell-Malm – The Race) Lando, you said on Thursday if you're going to go to any circuit and see if you've got the feel for a car, it would be here. Is this the best you felt in the '25 McLaren this season? And how much did that help going into Q3, because that's where it's gone wrong a couple of times this year.
||
LN: I think it's been clear-ish from the outside, and I think the feelings have correlated to inside, in terms of the car has just felt very strong. It clearly is very strong here, and very quick. I think where we expect it to be a little bit weak, or not as strong as some of the others in the high speed, seems to have been our strength all weekend so far. It's still trickier in some places, but on the whole, it was easily my best qualifying of the year from a delivery point of view from every single lap I did. I still made a couple of mistakes here and there, but none that cost me a lap or anything, just maybe a tenth here or half a tenth there. So, I think on deliveries, consistency and of course putting it in when it counts in Q3 was easily the best lap I've done for this whole season, probably even better than Monaco, honestly. Maybe not as exciting a lap as Monaco, but definitely a better put together lap than I did there. Some of that is small things that have allowed me to get that out of the car from the changes within the car. Whether that's the upgrades or not, it's always very difficult to tell still, but it was definitely, like you said, the most confident and comfortable I've been in terms of getting lap time out of the car and understanding that. I think it showed today that when I have those feelings, well, it's still not all there, but more there than before, I can have a day like today. So it shows that the feelings I've been requiring, the feelings that I've not been getting as easily, when they are more my way and more where I want them to be, I can put in better performances and have days like today. So, I think that's reassuring for myself, which is a very nice feeling. But it's still about consistency. This is one weekend, I’ve got to do it for another, what, 12 or 13 or something.
||
Q: (Christian Menath – Motorsport-magazin.com) Question for you, Oscar. You touched on it earlier that only FP1 was a bit messy for you, the rest was okay. But do you see a pattern where you lose time against Lando? Is it just a matter of Lando being exceptionally good here?
||
OP: I mean, it was changing a little bit throughout practice and qualifying, to be honest. I think some of my weaker corners at the start of the weekend became a bit stronger, some of the better ones became a bit weaker, so it wasn't a clear thing that was different every single time. I think it's been, like I said before, it's a difficult track to get everything together every lap, and maybe that was slightly the difference today. I felt like I was in the game and there. Just first lap of Q3 was a little bit messy, and then, of course, I didn't get to do the second one. So, yeah, I think there was a lot more potential out there today, just it didn't show.
||
Q: (Ronald Vording – Motorsport.com). It's another one to Lando, following up on the feelings that you just mentioned. How much of that do you feel is down to your own process where you talked about some weeks ago of constantly improving qualifying and working on those weaknesses, and how much is the car and more specifically the team working on the front end of the car and giving you the feeling that you want from it?
||
LN: I mean, it's a bit of both. Hard to put a percentage on it. But I said at the beginning of the weekend when we all sat down, like, I still expect more from myself at times. No matter what car I get given, I still expect to do a good job in whatever car that is, whether I struggle with some of the feelings or not. But, you know, when you're fighting against the best, you want everything to feel the best possible. This weekend, I feel like I've had a little bit more of that. It could also be a bit track-specific rather than just car-specific, because there have been some tracks this season I felt more comfortable than others. But it is a small element from the team, and it's also down to myself quite often. I was quick in Canada for the most part and made mistakes there and misjudged many things there, and didn't put the laps together when I needed to. But the pace was there, and that wasn't through a lack of feeling. That was through not doing a good enough job for myself. So, I'm never going to just blame the car, and I'm never going to say I blame anything, but there are reasons for different things. What's most reassuring for me is when I've got some other feelings that I need, I do do a better job. That's the best news that comes out of some of these things.
||
Q: (Luc Domenjoz – Le Matin) Charles, you have new parts here which allow you to be on first row again. But where do you think you lose out to the McLarens? And will the new parts you will bring at Silverstone allow you to catch up with the McLarens?
||
CL: There's nothing been confirmed yet for Silverstone, so I won't comment on that. Of course, there are upgrades in the waiting, but I don't exactly know when they will be ready. However, I think we are losing mostly on the high speed this weekend, which was expected. We expected to lose a little bit compared to McLaren in the high speed, but probably we expected to lose even more in the low speed, which was a little bit less the case. So, we'll analyse that. Obviously, we've brought an upgrade as well, and we are still in the learning process of understanding exactly what it does to the car. However, it seems to be working as expected. To reply to your question, very happy to be second. It's been a very difficult season for us qualifying-wise. We've always been fighting for P5, P6 in best cases apart from Monaco. That was a one-off. So, it's good to be starting a little bit further up, and to be straight away with the fast guys, straight from the start.
||
Q: (Ronald Vording – Motorsport.com) It's one for both McLaren drivers. I guess the two of you said yesterday that you can never rule out Max Verstappen, especially not on a track like this, given his qualifying record. So are you surprised to see Red Bull struggling as much as they did today? And also, even though Charles is up there, does it make you believe that this championship is looking more and more like a fight between just the two of you?
||
LN: I mean, Max has been our main contender for every race this season. I think just because he's had a slightly worse qualifying today, definitely not going to count him out of the race tomorrow and definitely not going to count him out for the rest of the season. They brought upgrades. Maybe they've not worked as well as they wanted or maybe they have. I don't know. But I think we expected them to be quicker here this weekend. They've still looked pretty good for the most part this weekend, but I don't know what happened to Max in Q3. So, no. I think, of course, we as team-mates are probably the main rivals of each other at the minute. But at the same time, I don't think we're ever – until he's out of the race – I don't think we're ever going to take Max out of the equation. It's still a very long season. So, I think people just need to chill out a little bit. And we'll see tomorrow.
||
OP: I don't have that much to add, but I think at this point of the year, it's still too early to rule out Max. I agree. I think we expected more from him this weekend, or in qualifying, because he looked very close in a lot of the practice sessions. So, I don't know if he also got caught out by the yellow flag. It's too early at the moment.

||
Piastri was one of two drivers, along with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, affected by the caution when Pierre Gasly lost control of his Alpine at the last corner and spun on the start/finish straight.
||
While team mate Lando Norris managed to get a second lap in and ultimately finished half a second clear of Charles Leclerc, having dominated Qualifying up to that point, Piastri could place no higher than third.
||
Piastri admitted after the session that beating Norris to pole position would have been unlikely, given the Briton’s impressive form so far this weekend, but feels a 1-2 result was on the cards for McLaren until the yellow flags.
||
Asked about looking disappointed when he stepped out of the car, Piastri said: “It was the fact that I didn’t get to start it, that was the problem. I had Gasly spin at the last corner, so I didn’t even open my second lap.
||
“Lando’s been very quick all weekend, so it would have been a tough challenge [to beat him], but I think we easily had enough pace in the car this weekend to be on the front row.
||
“It’s always a shame when you don’t even get the chance, but we can still have a good race from there. Sometimes it’s just not your day.”
||
Pushed on whether he feels there is a strong opportunity to move forward during the race, with overtaking spots aplenty at the Red Bull Ring, Piastri replied: “Yeah, definitely. I think our pace this weekend has looked very strong.
||
“I think the Ferrari pace looked good as well, which was a bit of a surprise, but I think we’ve still got some opportunities tomorrow. I’m not planning on finishing third, that’s for sure!”
||
Piastri will start the race at the top of the Drivers’ Championship standings, 22 points clear of Norris and a further 21 points up on Verstappen, who starts back in seventh position.

||
Norris missed the opening session to give F2 racer and McLaren junior Alex Dunne a run in the MCL39, but the Briton was immediately on the pace when he returned to action in FP2.
||
Norris’ best time of 1m 04.580s put him 0.157s up on team mate Piastri, with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen more than three-tenths of a second back at one of the shortest tracks on the calendar.
||
Assessing his and the team’s first day at the Red Bull Ring, Norris said: “I think the car felt good from the off. Alex gave good feedback this morning after FP1 and he was on the pace straight away, so that was good to see.
||
“I think they moved the car in the right direction for FP2, and we just need to understand if we want more of that tomorrow, or a little bit less, or somewhere in the middle.
||
“Good steps in the right direction, but still a little bit more to come hopefully.”
||
Norris does, however, expect McLaren’s rivals to turn up the heat as the weekend progresses – predicting a “tight” battle for pole position.
||
“I think as a team we seemed a bit more competitive,” he continued. “I think we definitely didn’t look that good this morning, so I think we did move things in the right direction.
||
“I think as always we are very quick in FP2 at times [and] we’ve shown a bit more pace than some of the others. I certainly think they’re going to catch up, Max is not far behind, and they [Red Bull] normally improve a lot into Saturday.
||
“I expect a good day tomorrow and I’m sure we’ll improve on some things, but it’s not as easy as maybe it looked today. I think it’s still going to be tight tomorrow, it always is, there’s no reason for it not to be, but we’ll work hard to make it as big of a gap as possible.”
||
Piastri echoed Norris’ comments about McLaren’s early pace and what their rivals might be able to do overnight, earmarking Verstappen as a particular “threat” in Qualifying.
||
“It looked pretty good,” Piastri commented. “Max is still close, so I think he’ll be definitely a threat this weekend. But no, the car’s feeling good, I think the pace is quite good, so a positive first day.”
||
With Norris reporting that McLaren’s recent upgrades have moved the car “in the right direction”, Piastri also gave his take on the developments – and whether he is using the new front suspension debuted by Norris in Montreal.
||
“There’s some other bits and pieces… I’m not using the bits that came in Canada, because they’re not an upgrade, they’re just different,” he confirmed. “All the parts that we think will make the car faster are on both cars.”

||
Norris immediately admitted his mistake after he ran into the back of his McLaren team mate's car as he battled to find a way through in Montreal and said later that he was sorry for ""being stupid"", while team boss Andrea Stella said two McLarens making contact is ""not acceptable"".
||
It's no surprise, then, that when the paddock regrouped in Austria, Piastri and Norris – who currently sit first and second in the Drivers' Championship – were still the big topic of conversation.
||
Piastri was first to face the media, through his appearance in the official press conference. Naturally, the subject dominated the half an hour session and, as has been the case throughout his time in F1 and indeed junior formulae, Piastri handled every question with his trademark coolness.
||
The first topic was the post-race debrief, which Piastri joked began ""on the way to the stewards room"" in Montreal after the collision before adding more seriously: ""We spoke about it honestly before we even got back to the team. Lando put his hands up and apologised, so all good and looking forward to racing again.""
||
Norris faced the media via the TV pen later in the day and a separate session with written media.
||
While it's clear the Briton remains disappointed at the way things went down in Canada, he does appear to have picked himself up and brushed himself off quickly.
||
""Obviously a little different to normal but it was good,"" he said of the debrief. ""I think the team handled everything very well. Of course it's never the nicest position to be in but I think more for myself rather than anyone else.
||
""It was more my pain than anyone else but it was all good. Everyone was very much onboard on resetting and making sure we're ready to focus on here and not letting it effect our races and our championship and what we're here to fight for which is a very good thing.""
||
McLaren has been keen to avoid team orders and let their drivers fight it out, but within their permitted so-called papaya-rules.
||
As a reminder, boss Zak Brown defined those rules as ""race him [your team mate] hard, race him clean, don’t touch"". That obviously happened in Canada but McLaren have no plan to change things.
||
""Same as always,"" said Piastri of McLaren's intention to keep things as they were. ""What happened in Canada wasn’t ideal, but we’re still free to race, we are still fighting for a championship each. So, no, keep going racing and make sure that we don't come into contact again.""
||
Norris has become engrained in McLaren since joining the operation in 2017, initially as part of their development programme, and he considers them family. That's why the incident hurt even more because he felt he had let everyone down.
||
But he dealt with the tough conversations and reaction head-on and has since reflected that it has ultimately made McLaren stronger.
||
""I think from that point it was, yeah, an unfortunate positive,"" he said. ""Between the trust and the honesty I think that Oscar and I have for one another, it's important that we keep it up, we stay strong as a team because we don't want to have the downfall that we know many other teams have had in the past.
||
""We want to race each other fair and hard and on the limit and not have a repeat of what happened last time out, and that takes both of us, even though Canada was on me, so, yeah, from a mentality point of view, from a constructive point of view, I think that's why it was positive.""
||
Piastri leads Norris by 22 points - almost a Grand Prix win. When a team haven't won a drivers' championship for nearly two decades, it's inevitable that there will be questions about when and if the team will choose to favour one over the other at some stage. The Australian, though, gave such talk short-shrift.
||
""I think, for me, I just want – and we all want – a fair opportunity trying to win both championships, especially in the Drivers' Championship, because ultimately, it can only be one of us,"" he said.
||
""I think the situation has to change dramatically to start having those conversations, and they’re a very long way away at the moment.
||
""So at the moment, all I can ask for is a fair chance to try and win the championship, and that’s what I want as well. No, I’m not willing to enter those talks at all.""
||
After one of their more challenging weekends in Canada, where Mercedes seemed to have the edge on them, both Piastri and Norris, whose McLaren team have brought upgrades to Austria, were optimistic Spielberg's Red Bull Ring should be a happier hunting ground.
||
""We got taken by surprise a little bit that we weren’t as strong as we hoped in Canada, but hopefully it’s a one-off,"" said Piastri. ""By the time we got to qualifying, I think we were in a better place and in the race, our pace was actually not bad, just we qualified a bit further back.
||
""I think we kind of understand what went wrong in Canada. So, we'll try and have a better weekend here, but I’m confident we'll be back on top form.""
||
Norris was in the fight for the win last year before a collision with rival Max Verstappen at Turn 3 ended his race and left the door open for George Russell – winner of the last race in Canada – to sneak through to win.
||
And the place holds a special place in his heart as it was the scene of his first podium. That's perhaps another reason why he's feeling better than expected ahead of this weekend.
||
""If there is any track that I kind of would say I would go to, to give myself the best feeling and make myself most comfortable, it's probably here, just from my stats, from my enjoyment of the circuit and, yeah, some of the memories that I've had here as well, so a good one,"" he said.
||
""But every weekend's new and there's already a lot of good learnings from last weekend.""
||
And naturally Piastri, who has won five races so far this season and tops the table, is feeling like he's in a good place, too.
||
""I'm enjoying the position I'm in at the moment,"" he said. ""It's a position I've been in before in my junior career.
||
""I look at it quite simply, it normally means you're doing something right if you're leading a championship. That's not to say there aren't things I can improve on; Canada was a scrappy weekend.
||
""There have been a couple this year that have not been as good as I wanted, but there have also been a lot that have looked as good as I wanted.
||
""I'm just trying to make every weekend look like that - that's the most important thing. What's happening with anyone else on the grid, I'm not really concerned by.
||
""Ultimately, to try and win the championship, I need to put my best foot forward. If I do that, then I know it’s enough to win.""
||
So, it's as you were, then. We've got two drivers, in arguably the best car on the grid, with the bit between their teeth and anxious to snatch the momentum in the championship fight. Bring it on.

The duo join a long list of team mates who have clashed on the track, so it seems only fitting to take a look through the archive at 12 of the most dramatic intra-team collisions in F1 history…
||
If it is of any consolation to Norris and Piastri, their incident was near to being a mirror image of one that occurred at the same area of the track between two previous McLaren team mates 14 years earlier.
||
The 2011 Canadian Grand Prix has gone down in F1 lore for numerous reasons, ranging from the fact that it was the longest race ever (at four hours, four minutes and 39 seconds) to its changing weather conditions, numerous incidents and Jenson Button’s incredible recovery drive to victory.
||
That action-packed afternoon for Button began with a dramatic moment involving the other McLaren of Lewis Hamilton. As he attempted to find a way past his team mate down the start/finish straight on Lap 7, Hamilton put a nose to the left-hand side of Button’s car.
||
However, given the tricky conditions, Button could not see Hamilton through the spray and the pair made contact, putting Hamilton out of the race while Button somehow continued on to what would be an incredibly memorable 10th win in Formula 1.
||
Another example of McLaren drivers colliding comes courtesy of Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard. The 1999 Austrian Grand Prix came just two weeks after Michael Schumacher suffered a broken leg during Round 8 at Silverstone – and, with this putting the German out of action, Ferrari switched focus to supporting Eddie Irvine’s championship bid.
||
Reigning World Champion Hakkinen, meanwhile, was seeking a second title and led the Drivers’ standings arriving into Austria. The Finn bolstered his prospects of maintaining this by grabbing pole position in Qualifying ahead of team mate Coulthard.
||
However, that hard work looked to have been undone on Lap 1 of Sunday’s race when Coulthard tapped the back of Hakkinen’s MP4/14, sending the latter into a spin and dropping him to the back of the field.
||
Hakkinen managed to recover to a final result of third while title rival Irvine claimed victory, eating into the Finnish driver’s championship lead. Like Norris, Coulthard took responsibility for the incident, labelling it a “mistake on my part”.
||
While that incident between Hakkinen and Coulthard ended amicably, the same could not be said when Mercedes’ Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton took each other out at the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix in perhaps one of the most infamous intra-team collisions of recent times.
||
Tensions had long been building between the karting rivals turned F1 team mates, who had previously gone head-to-head for the championship in 2014 and 2015. Hamilton had proven triumphant in both years, but it was Rosberg who had enjoyed the stronger start to 2016, winning all four of the campaign’s opening races.
||
While Hamilton had secured pole position ahead of Rosberg at Round 5 in Barcelona, the German snatched the lead on Lap 1. Hamilton then tried to overtake down the inside on the approach to Turn 4 but Rosberg defended and contact occurred, sending Hamilton into a spin before collecting his team mate.
||
As both cars ended up beached in the gravel, Mercedes’ race was over before it had started – opening the door for a certain Max Verstappen to claim his maiden F1 victory on his debut for Red Bull.
||
This incident was arguably a key flashpoint in the rivalry between Rosberg and Hamilton, but it was of course not their first or last clash; the team mates previously made contact at Belgium’s Spa-Francorchamps in 2014, while a last-lap collision later in 2016 at the Austrian Grand Prix only increased tensions within the Mercedes camp.
||
Like Rosberg and Hamilton, Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon had some history when they were paired up as team mates at Alpine in 2023. The two French drivers were childhood friends who were karting together from the age of six, but their relationship became strained as the years went by.
||
Both insisted that there would be no issues in working together at Alpine – and that was put to the test when they suffered a collision just three races in at the 2023 Australian Grand Prix, a chaotic event that saw a second race restart take place with two laps remaining.
||
As Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz and the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso made contact ahead, Gasly tried to take avoiding action but collided with Ocon as he rejoined the track, putting both out of the race with heavy damage. Ocon later revealed that Gasly had apologised for the incident.
||
The situation was reversed somewhat when they made contact again one year later in Monaco after Ocon made a bold move down the inside of the Portier corner, sending his car airborne over Gasly’s.
||
While a furious Gasly was able to continue despite the damage to his car, Ocon subsequently retired from the race and received a five-place grid penalty for the next event, as well as taking to social media to apologise.
||
Ocon makes a second appearance in this list courtesy of a run-in with Force India team mate Sergio Perez at the 2018 Singapore Grand Prix, marking the most dramatic of a series of collisions that took place between the pair.
||
After numerous incidents occurred in 2017, the squad imposed an order that Ocon and Perez could no longer race each other without team orders. This was lifted for 2018, meaning that the duo were free to battle when F1 headed to the Marina Bay Street Circuit.
||
After both started within the top 10, Ocon tried to make a move on Perez around the outside at Turn 3 – but their Force India cars subsequently banged wheels, sending Ocon into the wall. Perez later stated that he had not seen his team mate there.
||
The clash was deemed “unacceptable” by team boss Otmar Szafnauer and resulted in him reintroducing the previous rule of no racing between his drivers.
||
Like Ocon and Perez, another pairing that experienced their fair share of dramas whilst racing together was the Red Bull duo of Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber, who were team mates at the squad between 2009 and 2013.
||
While some of their tense moments did not necessarily boil over into contact – see Multi 21 – the rivalry did result in a collision at the 2010 Turkish Grand Prix. Webber was leading both the championship and the race when Vettel tried to challenge into Turn 11 on Lap 40, resulting in them tangling at high-speed.
||
This sent Vettel spinning off with a puncture and ended his race, leading to an inadvertent moment of radio gold as the German shouted: “What a stupid action! I’m going home.” Webber, on the other hand, was not heading home and managed to limp back to the pits, continuing on to a P3 result.
||
Webber also maintained his championship lead after the race but, in a closely fought season, it was Vettel who ultimately clinched his debut title at the season finale in Abu Dhabi.
||
Red Bull perhaps initially experienced a slightly more harmonious relationship between their drivers when Max Verstappen joined forces with Daniel Ricciardo in 2016, the duo both racing hard whilst remaining friends off the track.
||
But their growing rivalry seemed to come to a head at the 2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix. After losing a position to his team mate at the start, Ricciardo spent much of the race chasing Verstappen and was getting increasingly close by Lap 40.
||
The Australian looked to make a move towards the first corner but – as Verstappen tried to defend – hit the back of the sister Red Bull, causing both to dramatically veer off the track and out of the race.
||
Both drivers were deemed at fault by the stewards and each was issued with a reprimand. Team boss Christian Horner also took that view and decided that Ricciardo and Verstappen would both formally apologise to the whole squad at their headquarters in Milton Keynes.
||
The sight of both Red Bull cars skating off the track is certainly a memorable one – but, in terms of visually dramatic team mate clashes, it is hard to beat the incident that occurred between Minardi’s Christian Fittipaldi and Pierluigi Martini at Monza in 1993.
||
As the two cars approached the chequered flag in seventh and eighth, Fittipaldi was running close behind the other Minardi and tried to overtake. However, the Brazilian’s left front tyre made contact with Martini’s right rear wheel, resulting in Fittipaldi’s car launching into the air.
||
After completing a spectacular 360-degree somersault, he then landed back on the tarmac and incredibly still crossed the finish line in P8, despite losing a wheel along the way. Martini also held onto his original position of P7.
||
Speaking to the Beyond The Grid podcast last year, Fittipaldi recalled his relief at escaping the incident unharmed as he explained: “When the car went up, a little film of my life crossed my mind. And then I thought, ‘If the car doesn’t go all the way around, I’m probably done.’”
||
Thirty years on from that infamous Minardi clash, another team mate collision occurred – this time between the two Mercedes drivers at the 2023 Qatar Grand Prix.
||
George Russell had lined up in P2 on the grid for the event, with the other Silver Arrows machine of Lewis Hamilton just behind in third, and the former took the fight to polesitter Max Verstappen off the line.
||
Hamilton also enjoyed a strong launch and attempted to go around the outside of both Russell and Verstappen – only to make contact with Russell along the way, sending the seven-time World Champion into the gravel and out of the race at the first corner.
||
While Hamilton stated over the radio that he had been “taken out by my own team mate”, the Briton later took responsibility for what he deemed to be a “racing incident”. Russell went on to finish the race in fourth.
||
Colliding with a team mate once is not ideal – so imagine the headache for an F1 squad when their drivers come together at two races in a row.
||
The Prost outfit had been struggling during the 2000 season, despite a line-up combining experience and youth in Jean Alesi and Nick Heidfeld, and those troubles looked to be continuing at team boss Alain Prost’s home event, the French Grand Prix, when Heidfeld nudged Alesi into a spin.
||
Two weeks later, when the F1 paddock moved on to Austria, history repeated itself as another incident occurred between the two Prost cars. This time it was Alesi who ran into Heidfeld – and the consequences were worse than during their previous clash, with both cars immediately out of the Grand Prix.
||
This was somewhat symbolic of what was a challenging campaign for the team, marking the only season during their five-year stint in F1 in which they failed to score any points.
||
Sebastian Vettel was faced with a new challenge in 2019 when the highly-rated Charles Leclerc joined Ferrari as his team mate, the Monegasque having impressed during his rookie season with Sauber in 2018.
||
Leclerc had outscored Vettel by the time of the penultimate race of the campaign in Brazil, sitting third in the championship while Vettel was back in fifth. And while Vettel had been running ahead of the other Ferrari for much of the Grand Prix in Sao Paulo, Leclerc was hot on his tail as they battled for fourth with just a few laps remaining.
||
The driver from Monaco overtook into Turn 1 before Vettel tried to take the position back into Turn 3, but the pair banged wheels and both picked up terminal damage to their cars, resulting in a double DNF for the Scuderia.
||
“I think at the end that both of them have got at least a small or part percentage of responsibility,” Team Principal Mattia Binotto commented after the race, while both drivers offered their apologies for the incident.
||
And now we arrive at perhaps one of the most infamous team mate collisions – and rivalries – in the history of Formula 1. When Ayrton Senna partnered with Alain Prost at McLaren in 1988, an all-star driver line-up was formed, with the pair winning all but one race in a dominant campaign that saw Senna claim his debut World Championship.
||
The McLaren duo once again went head-to-head for the crown in 1989, and Prost was sitting atop the Drivers’ standings entering into the penultimate race of the campaign at Suzuka. Senna secured pole position, but Prost grabbed the lead after making a stronger start than his rival.
||
After chasing down his team mate throughout the race, Senna was fighting Prost for the lead on Lap 47 of 53 when they collided at the Casio Triangle chicane. This immediately put Prost out of the race, while Senna rejoined and went on to win.
||
However, the Brazilian was subsequently disqualified for cutting the chicane when he returned to the track post-collision, meaning that Prost had sealed his third World Championship.
||
The Frenchman departed McLaren for Ferrari in 1990, bringing an end to one of the most tense team mate relationships F1 has seen. But that did not put a stop to the rivalry, as the pair again duelled for the championship in 1990 – culminating in another controversial title showdown at Suzuka, with Senna becoming the champion on that occasion.

||
George Russell charged to both pole position and the race win at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, where Mercedes introduced a new rear suspension aimed at better managing tyre temperatures, with team mate Kimi Antonelli backing him up to score a maiden F1 podium.
||
It came after McLaren duo Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri dramatically made contact in the closing stages of the encounter, eliminating the former from the race while the latter took the chequered flag fourth to extend his championship lead to 22 points.
||
Rosberg, F1’s 2016 World Champion and a 23-time Grand Prix winner, was present in Montreal as a Sky Sports F1 pundit, and spoke exclusively to F1.com about the various twists and turns of the race that set up an intriguing second half of the campaign.
||
Asked for his reaction to what unfolded, Rosberg said: “First of all, Mercedes, are they back? That’s the question mark, because they dominated the weekend.
||
""We know that this track does suit them, but they also have a new geometry, so is the new geometry maybe the solution for them?
||
“Then, in the World Championship fight, I think now Piastri has become the favourite. He’s just solid, he doesn’t mistakes, always delivering 100% – that’s super impressive. This weekend, suddenly, I think he’s become the favourite for the championship.”
||
Rosberg went on to review the collision between Norris and Piastri along the start/finish straight – the German having experienced his own internal battle for the title alongside Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes across the 2014, 2015 and 2016 seasons.
||
“It’s just a misjudgement,” said Rosberg. “A strange one… a strange misjudgement. But you know, at the end of the race there… it’s a very tough race mentally and your concentration struggles, and that I think led Lando into a misjudgement.”
||
While Piastri is Rosberg’s favourite for the crown, he is not yet ruling out Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who stayed out of trouble to split the Mercedes drivers in second position and make up some ground in the championship standings.
||
With 10 rounds of 24 completed, Verstappen is 43 points behind leader Piastri, and 21 points adrift of Norris – the Dutchman pushing to make it a record-equalling five successive world titles next to Michael Schumacher’s 2000-2004 run.
||
“This helps Max to still hang in there for now, but he needs a better car,” Rosberg added. “I don’t know if Red Bull’s going to be able to deliver that. He’s obviously… he’s the best driver for me out there, but he needs a better car.”

"['oscar-piastri', 'lando-norris']","['Oscar Piastri', 'Lando Norris']",PALMER: The Canada crash with Piastri was a clumsy error – but there is a silver lining for Norris,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/palmer-the-canada-crash-with-piastri-was-a-major-misjudgment-but-there-is-a.15hjhlxFzmpWlS1fXX0QYC,Former F1 driver Jolyon Palmer picks the bones out of the most dramatic moment from the Canadian Grand Prix.,"So the long anticipated clash of the McLarens finally happened: Lando Norris hit the back of Oscar Piastri and retired from the Canadian Grand Prix. It was clearly Lando’s error and the Briton immediately admitted that he was to blame, but let’s take a look at how it all came about.
||
Norris was generally faster than Piastri in Canada. While the McLaren car didn’t look as overwhelmingly competitive in Montreal as it has at most other venues this year, Lando was still able to find competitive lap times in practice, before running well in the first two parts of Qualifying.
||
Meanwhile Oscar was looking slightly scrappier and was struggling to get time out of the car.
||
But it all changed when the pressure was added to the mix. Searching for a pole lap, Norris’ first flying lap saw him cut the chicane at the final corner, and his second new tyre effort saw him understeer off towards the barrier on the exit of Turn 7 and lose any chance of a respectable starting position.
||
His best effort ended up being a banker lap he did on a second run on his first set of tyres.
||
It looks to me like Lando is struggling more with the pressure of the big moments. The McLaren front suspension upgrade for him in Canada was an attempt to give him more feel in the car, yet he’s still making errors that I haven’t really seen from him in Qualifying until this year.
||
In the race it looked like it was another misjudgement, under a self-imposed pressure.
||
Again Norris was the stronger of the two McLarens on Sunday, charging through from seventh on the grid to get within striking distance of his team mate, who was having one of his more lacklustre races having started third.
||
It was a battle for fourth position. There wasn’t even a spot on the podium available for the winner of this particular fight – and only a minor points gain – so really there was little need for a big risk. It still felt important to see if Norris could overcome Piastri though. Had he got by it would have given him a four point swing out of his team mate – and more importantly, given him a big confidence boost.
||
But overtaking looked pretty difficult for those without a big tyre advantage, and so when Lando managed to force the issue with a tidy lunge on the inside of Oscar at Turn 10, he would have known this was it, his one opportunity.
||
Oscar is a fantastic wheel-to-wheel racer. We’ve seen it routinely now, and he defended well at the final chicane, holding it late on the brakes and keeping position, but compromising his exit.
||
This was Lando’s final shot. If you can’t make it through at Turn 1 there are no more overtaking opportunities until Turn 10, and he could be certain that Oscar would be more aware of that attempt now that Lando had shown his hand.
||
It looked to me that it was this feeling of a desperate last chance that led Lando to chase a gap on the inside that was never there and ruin all of the good work of his race. From the outside it looks like one of the more clumsy errors from a title contender, and there’s no denying it is.
||
From inside the cockpit though these moments play out quickly. You are sitting low down to the ground, with a racing heart rate and adrenaline coursing through your veins. This is the moment you’ve been waiting 66 laps for – a chance to have a crack at your title rival and make the difference on track.
||
Lando said he thought he saw Oscar move to the right-hand side slightly and expected the Aussie to move more, thus affording him space for the inside at Turn 1.
||
Obviously in hindsight, he should have stayed to the right, had the shorter run to the braking zone and a possible chance to go around the outside of his team mate, but having just been quelled at the previous turn, it was clear that he was determined to get to the inside come hell or high water.
||
It was as if he was just willing a space to open, when in reality Piastri is too smart a racer to allow that.
||
Some people have drawn a comparison to the other Montreal McLaren clash between Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button in 2011. A brief look at both incidents tells the same story, however the way they came together is critically different.
||
Hamilton had an overlap on Button in 2011 and therefore was entitled to some space next to his team mate. Norris was desperate to force that same move, but the space was never there and Lando was never alongside. He simply drove into the back of Oscar.
||
In 2011 the move was more contentious and the result quite different. Despite having a puncture, Button went on to win one of Formula 1’s most dramatic races, while Hamilton retired with damage.
||
In 2025 I think McLaren – and probably even Norris – will be pleased that the incident didn’t take both cars out, even though it has ended up costing Lando 12 more points in the championship. The fact that Oscar actually benefitted from it, and Lando immediately held his hands up, means that the team will probably get away without civil war just yet.
||
Nonetheless it’s a real signal of intent as to the risks Norris will take in racing his team mate now. It shows that the time for any pretence of teamwork is over and it is most definitely gloves off for the rest of the season. Piastri takes his biggest points advantage yet to the next race and Norris has another week of regret to think about what he might have done differently.
||
The silver lining for him is that the pace was there. This looked like Norris’ best race drive of 2025 until the contact and he’ll take confidence from that. It’s just in the pressure moments that we are seeing too many errors.
||
His Abu Dhabi win last year was under Constructors’ Championship pressure though and you don’t get a more intense Qualifying than Monaco, where he took pole, so we know he can do it, he just needs to find some momentum. This was another blot, but the championship is most certainly not over yet.

"['oscar-piastri', 'lando-norris']","['Oscar Piastri', 'Lando Norris']",TECH WEEKLY: The unique McLaren design feature that seems to have affected Norris more than Piastri,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/tech-weekly-the-unique-mclaren-design-feature-that-seems-to-have-affected.6Nu1IcMy8bYP6CoaaAEK3G,"Lando Norris has mentioned how this year's McLaren does not give him the same level of confidence as last year's, and a key design feature could be the reason.","At a few of the hotter races so far this year McLaren has used a unique cockpit pre-cooling device.
||
It works when the chemical ingredients of dry ice are mixed in a container, placed in the car’s nose, and the resultant emissions of the cooling vapour are pumped through the car for several minutes as it sits on the grid. The container is then removed before the nose is re-assembled ready for the race.
||
Furthermore, the underside of the McLaren seat and the floor beneath are coated in heat-deflecting gold foil.
||
Why so much attention to the cockpit temperatures of the McLaren? Possibly because the way the team runs the car means that the front skid blocks wear more than those at the rear, which is unusual.
||
What it also means is that the great heat generated by those skid blocks crashing into the ground is directly beneath the driver. In its running configuration, the McLaren seems to create more cockpit heat than other cars.
||
A notable feature of the design of the car is the extreme anti-dive of the front suspension geometry, allowing the car a very flat aerodynamic platform. With less dive under braking, the front ride height can be significantly lower. This might help explain the more forward-biased plank wear seen on the McLaren.
||
A downside of such extreme anti-dive geometry is that it reduces feedback through the steering and brakes to the driver. Lando Norris has, on several occasions, mentioned how this car does not give him the same level of confidence and feedback on corner entry as last year’s car.
||
His driving style favours more combined braking and cornering than Oscar Piastri’s and the reduced level of feedback seems to have affected him more.
||
Consequently McLaren has developed an alternative, mildly tweaked, geometry for Norris – and this made its first appearance at Montreal. Visually, it’s virtually indistinguishable from the standard suspension but the upper rear wishbone’s mounting point to the wheel hub has been re-angled.
||
The brake duct bodywork hides the new arrangement and so whether it uses a reduced level of anti-dive to enhance steering feel is not currently known. It may also be that the steering’s king pin inclination – the angle to the wheel of the part around which the steering swivels and a standard way of enhancing the steering’s feedback – has been altered.
||
If the anti-dive has been reduced on the new geometry, the downside of the improved steering feel would be that the car’s aero platform won’t be as flat and that its front ride height may need to be higher.
||
Norris stayed with the new suspension throughout the Canadian Grand Prix weekend. The new layout was available for Piastri but he opted to stick with the standard system.
||
“I could have run it if I wanted to, and I didn’t really,” he explained of the new layout.
||
“It changes some things — some things are better, some things are worse. It’s not as simple. It’s not an upgrade, it’s a different part.
||
""I’ve been happy with how the car’s been so far this year and, again, I just wanted to keep consistency.”

||
Mercedes' George Russell was the man of the weekend, claiming his first victory of the 2025 season, while his rookie team mate Kimi Antonelli took his maiden F1 podium. But it was the coming together of the title-challenging McLaren duo that had plenty of people talking post-race. Here's our round up of all the highlights from the Canadian Grand Prix weekened...
||
McLaren have long been open about the fact that they may be faced with a strong intra-team battle between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri going forwards; indeed, during Thursday’s media day in Montreal, Norris admitted that “at some point, something is probably going to happen”.
||
That prediction certainly came true just a few days later as the latter stages of the Canadian Grand Prix played out. While Piastri was trying to catch Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli for third place, Norris had closed in on his team mate as he looked to snatch fourth.
||
A move through the hairpin initially worked out for Norris – but Piastri had an answer, retaking the position into Turn 13. Norris then tried to make another move on the straight, only to brake late and hit the back of Piastri’s car. While the Australian was able to continue and finish in P4, Norris pulled his damaged MCL39 off the track, meaning that he leaves Montreal with no points.
||
The British driver was quick to take the blame for the incident and apologised to Piastri and the squad, having admitted that he “misjudged” the move. Piastri, meanwhile, labelled the clash as “a shame for the team”.
||
McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella acknowledged that the contact between the two drivers was “a situation that we know is not acceptable”, with Norris’ lack of points meaning that he “paid a price in the championship” as he now trails leader Piastri by 22 points.
||
However, Stella also praised Norris for taking accountability, whilst he also insisted that what happened does not change anything regarding the team’s approach going forward. Nevertheless, it will be fascinating to see how the Woking-based outfit regroup ahead of the next race on the calendar in Austria.
||
It had been a solid start to the 2025 season for Mercedes, having put themselves into second place of the Teams’ Championship during the opening races thanks to several podium finishes for Russell and additional points results courtesy of rookie Antonelli.
||
However, their strong run took a bit of a hit during the European triple header, leading to them losing that P2 spot to Ferrari last time out in Spain. The Silver Arrows were in need of a good weekend in Canada – and that was exactly what they came away with.
||
After clinching pole position on Saturday, Russell put in a commanding drive on Sunday – in a race that featured different strategies across the field, as well as a late-race Safety Car following the aforementioned McLaren collision – to seal both his and Mercedes’ first win of the campaign.
||
To make things even better, Antonelli enjoyed an eye-catching outing at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, the teenager overtaking Piastri at the start for P3 before maintaining that position later on, thus scoring his maiden podium in Formula 1.
||
Sandwiched between the Mercedes duo was Max Verstappen. The Red Bull man kept Russell honest during the opening laps of the race and further proved that he can never be discounted by again closing in on the leader as the Grand Prix reached its final stages.
||
While Russell managed to rebuild that gap – before the race ultimately ended under the Safety Car – Verstappen held onto second. A post-race protest by Red Bull against Russell – relating to allegations of driving erratically under the Safety Car and displaying unsportsmanlike behaviour – was rejected, meaning that the final result stands and Mercedes are once again in P2 of the Teams’ Championship.
||
From Charles Leclerc’s damaging FP1 crash, to Lewis Hamilton’s unfortunate collision with a groundhog in the race, Ferrari seemed to have another unfortunate weekend.
||
The Monegasque missed out on a valuable hour of FP2 due to his earlier incident, which left him scrambling to recover for Qualifying and ultimately saw him infuriated by his underwhelming lap which was only good enough for eighth place on the grid.
||
Despite some broadcasted disagreements with his race engineer over whether they should go for the one-stop strategy (Leclerc’s choice) or the two-stop (Ferrari’s choice), he improved to P5, which is where Hamilton originally started the race.
||
Once again, the seven-time champion was left in no man’s land as he suffered a broken floor and ineffective brake pedal that led to him crossing the line over seven seconds adrift of his team mate, but he was satisfied to even score with all of the car’s issues.
||
Ferrari might not be over the moon with the result, but someone who should be pleased is Kick Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg, who finished in P8 to score points for the second consecutive round and third time this season. A superb double overtake on the opening lap saw him gain two positions from Alex Albon and Franco Colapinto, and he kept the pace up until the chequered flag fell.
||
Pole positions had eluded Mercedes this season until they came to Montreal, where Russell put together a remarkable lap at the last second to beat Verstappen and Piastri to the top spot on medium tyres.
||
The Brackley outfit have not hidden the fact that their car prefers cooler temperatures, but the truth of that was well and truly revealed this weekend as Russell repeatedly set the benchmark over their typically faster rivals.
||
After the initial runs in Q3, Verstappen was top of the timesheets having gone marginally faster than the lead McLaren, while Russell could only scrape third place ahead of his rookie team mate Kimi Antonelli.
||
The top two improved again on their final attempts, but they were toppled by the Briton as he swept past in the dying seconds to secure pole position by over a tenth to the Red Bull driver. For the second year in a row, Russell was able to surge to the most wanted grid spot thanks to a lap that he described as ""one of the most exhilarating"" in his life.
||
F1 ACADEMY was in action in Montreal, with three separate races across the weekend (due to one race being postponed at the previous round in Miami). It was the first of these that provided much of the drama though, with crashes galore amidst non-stop action.
||
McLaren were not the only team to see their team mates collide this weekend, the same fate befalling Chloe Chambers and Alisha Palmowski, who were battling for the lead. Doriane Pin subsequently won for Mercedes, one of very few to keep out of trouble in a race that featured a Safety Car and multiple other crashes and a car returning to the track in a rather hair-raising manner.
||
Emma Felbermayr was disqualified from the first race for a technical infringement, having originally finished third, but she bounced back in style to win the second race with a last-lap move on Nina Gademan. Then Chambers took the third win of the weekend to make up for her crash in the first race, having to negotiate not one but two Safety Cars enroute to her first victory of the year.
||
The action was non-stop, emotions were riding high but the women in F1 ACADEMY delivered three drama-filled races that had the fans on the edge of their seat throughout.
||
Ben Stiller made an appearance in the paddock at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, the actor keen to get a taste of F1 action. He watched a thrilling Qualifying session on Saturday, as he was treated to Russell's aforementioned pole lap.
||
Russell’s Pirelli award was appropriately handed out by Canadian swimming star Summer McIntosh. The 18-year-old sensation, who won three gold medals at last year’s Olympic Games may well have inspired her fellow teenager Antonelli – the Italian of course delivering his first F1 podium.
||
NFL stars Sydney Brown, Chase Brown and Matthew Bergeron all came down for the show, but after embarrassing themselves with some dubious footballing skills in Miami, the Haas drivers opted to try out another Canadian pastime in Montreal – ice hockey.
||
Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman took turns as goalie, but neither look set to give up their day jobs just yet.

||
Norris had been chasing Piastri in a battle for fourth place during the closing stages of the race when he initially got ahead at the hairpin. After Piastri then retook the position, Norris tried again to find a way past on the straight, but the Briton ran into the back of his team mate’s car.
||
This forced Norris to pull off the track and out of the race, while Piastri managed to continue and held onto fourth place after pitting under the subsequent Safety Car. Norris later apologised for the incident, with the 25-year-old blaming himself for a “misjudgement”, and he was also hit with a five-second penalty by the stewards for being at fault.
||
Asked for his take on the collision on F1 TV’s post-race show, Stella explained: “Well, we never want to see a McLaren car involved in an accident and definitely we don’t want to see the two McLarens having contact, so this situation is a situation that we know is not acceptable.
||
“At the same time, we appreciate that Lando immediately owned it and apologised to the team, which for us sort of reset the situation. I’m sure he has an important learning point coming from this race, he paid a price in the championship.
||
“Like I said, we appreciate his behaviour straight after the accident and we will go racing again.”
||
While the squad have always been clear on ‘papaya rules’, Stella was pushed on whether the incident might alter the situation going forwards.
||
“It doesn’t change things because it’s a misjudgement,” the Italian said. “It’s not like the driver had an intent that was beyond the principles, it was just a misjudgement of the proximity to the car ahead.
||
“If Lando had a different reaction, then there would have been certainly serious conversations to have, but I think he immediately realised that he simply miscalculated, this caused a problem for himself, for the team, and it was very close to causing a problem for Oscar.”
||
McLaren CEO Zak Brown, meanwhile, praised Norris for being open about his mistake as he took to social media to share his thoughts on the race in Montreal, in which George Russell and Kimi Antonelli took a 1-3 result for Mercedes while Red Bull’s Max Verstappen was second.
||
“Congrats Mercedes and Kimi on that first podium,” Brown wrote on Instagram. “Great stops from the team, with fast cars and drivers. And so, it happened. Appreciate the candor, Lando. Solid race Oscar. We learn. We go again together.”

This culminated in the McLaren pair qualifying in third and seventh place for the race, with Piastri as the lead driver to represent their best chance of challenging George Russell and Max Verstappen on the front row.
||
However, he was overtaken on the first lap by Kimi Antonelli, and after a series of pit stops Norris was able to catch up in the closing stage. While Piastri fought to keep him behind, his team mate tried to squeeze through a narrow gap, driving into the rear of the Australian’s car in the process and subsequently retiring with damage.
||
“I mean I obviously haven’t seen it so I don’t really know,” Piastri said after the race. “I was defending the inside and then felt a small touch and that’s honestly all I have at the moment.
||
“Obviously a shame for the team. It was a bit of a difficult race apart from that. Just not the easiest of weekends.

||
“I think our pace was okay in the second half and I think we were quicker than the cars around us, just not by enough. That just meant it was very tough to make much progress really.
||
“We struggled a bit on the medium but we seemed better when the graining happened for everybody. We just needed the race to be about 30 laps longer I think. Some things to learn.”
||
With McLaren currently the favourites to win both championships, it seemed probable that their two drivers would come to blows at some point – Norris himself admitted going into the weekend that it was a matter of “when” rather than “if”.
||
Despite the collision, Piastri was able to continue for the remaining laps behind the Safety Car and cross the line in fourth place, which is his first non-podium finish since the season opener in Melbourne.

The result has nevertheless allowed him to extend his lead over Norris in the standings, taking it from 10 points before today to 22 after the latter’s DNF.
||
Asked whether it’s important to make the most of it, Piastri said: “Yeah, definitely. I would have enjoyed it going a bit better than it did but you’ve got to take the results you get sometimes, and I think this is one of those weekends.”

“It’s just that Mercedes have looked very quick this weekend, Max has looked quick, we’ve potentially looked a little bit slower, and then you add in the medium tyre and it raises questions.

PARC FERMÉ INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by Jacques Villeneuve)
||
Q: Oscar, that's P3. It's not pole, but it looked like a very tough day. Was the car hard to drive? You touched the wall a little bit earlier. You're still there in the fight, plenty in the championship. Are you in a good position for the race?
||
Oscar PIASTRI: Yeah, to be honest, after how practice went, I'm pretty happy with myself at the moment. So, no, it was a nice turnaround. You know, there's always the question: do you want a medium or do you want a soft for Q3? And we went with a soft because we were having a lot of problems. We just wanted to keep things consistent. So, I'm pretty happy with it, which is a bit different this year, but I'll definitely take it here.
||
Q: Well, that's a good position for the championship with your team-mate so far behind. Good luck tomorrow.
||
OP: Thank you very much. Cheers.
||
Q: Max, you almost had it there. That was close. But, you know, on a tough track to drive in qualifying, just like Suzuka – take wing off, be quick, look to have top speed, but you're also quick in the corners. How do you manage that?
||
Max VERSTAPPEN: Yeah, I think I felt quite good all weekend. The car actually was in a good window. I mean, this track is quite cool. It feels a bit like a big go-kart on the kerbs. And then, of course, you have the long straights, heavy braking. You need to be quite efficient on the straight, which I think we are in general. Yeah, so I'm very happy with qualifying. I think the car was again working quite well. Then, of course, the tough choice was the tyres, which one to use. But I think we did the right thing.
||
Q: Now seeing the layout of Turn 1 and 2, is it actually a good thing to be P2, to be on the right side of the track?
||
MV: I mean, I would always pick P1. You just start a little bit more forward, but it's fine. I mean, we'll see what we can do tomorrow. I'm already very happy with what we achieved today, to be on the front row, and hopefully tomorrow we can have a solid race.
||
Q: Well, have fun tomorrow. Good luck.
||
MV: Thank you.
||
Q: Geroge, two years in a row, you don't have the top speed, but you managed to get that last lap in. And all season, you've just been getting there – not fighting for the win, getting the points, always staying in the championship hunt. But getting pole here today—was that the right moment?
||
George RUSSELL: Yeah, today was awesome in front of this amazing crowd as well, to get the pole. I mean, to be honest, that last lap was probably one of the most exhilarating laps of my life because on my steering wheel, you've got the delta, and I just saw every corner I was going one tenth quicker, one tenth quicker. And I got into the last corner and I was, you know, six tenths up. I was like, alright, this lap is mighty. And crossing the line, seeing we were P1, was a real surprise, but I was, yeah, so chuffed with it.
||
Q: Well, you have a tough fighter next to you. You're in the championship hunt, so tomorrow…
||
GR: We’re mates, so it’s all good!
||
Q: Until you put your helmet on, yes! So, Turn 1, the start of the race. He's got the top speed over you. Is it aggressive, go for the win, maximize the points in the championship, or continue massaging the championship points?
||
GR: I mean, I've got a few more points on my license to play with. So, yeah, let’s see.
||
PRESS CONFERENCE
||
Q: George, two in a row! What an incredible final lap. How sweet was it?
||
GR: Yeah, honestly, it was probably the most exhilarating lap I’ve ever done in my life because around this circuit you’ve got to be so committed. It’s not easy. It’s quite bumpy. It’s so easy to make a mistake. You know, I think I almost found seven tenths on that last lap. Every corner I was going a tenth faster, a tenth faster, and it was just like the car was on rails. I just felt in such a rhythm, and crossing the line, when you do a lap like that, to get pole position afterwards as well was just insane. I had goosebumps in that moment. I don’t think I’ve ever had goosebumps after a pole position or a good result. That one meant a lot to me.
||
Q: What difference did the Medium tyre make?
||
GR: I think that was definitely the faster tyre today. We've seen it a few times before. The qualifying was a tricky session. The people who were at the front—it was always variable. In Q1, I was further down the order. Then Q2, I had a good lap. First run in Q3, I was a bit off the pace—three or four tenths off—and it felt like a good lap as well, but the Medium really gave me that bit of extra confidence. But I think the gap still to Oscar on the Soft was still almost three tenths. So, I’m not saying I’d have been able to do just as good a lap on the Soft, but the Medium’s definitely not three tenths better than the Soft. So I think whatever tyre we had on for that lap, it would have been the one.
||
Q: Was the track still ramping up in Q3, still getting better?
||
GR: I think so. Every lap you do, the track’s always going faster and faster. Especially on a circuit like this, which is a street track, it’s a little bit windy, so you get a bit of dust on the circuit between the sessions. That’s why it’s always that very last lap in Q3 that counts, and that’s when… It doesn’t matter how the whole weekend goes and we’d been having a really strong weekend up until qualifying, so the pressure’s on. If you don’t perform as well as you did in practice, it’s a bit of an underperformance. But, obviously, getting that result was mega.
||
Q: Let’s throw it forward then to the race. There are a lot of variables to focus on. What do you think are going to be the biggest challenges for you?
||
GR: Right now, I’m not too sure. To be honest, we had good race pace on Friday, but it depends on the temperature. In practice, it was five degrees cooler than it was today, and the car was easily in its sweet spot. Now, it can easily go the other way tomorrow in the race. If the sun comes out—it’s a 2:00 race, it was a 4:00 qualifying today—that makes quite a bit of difference. So, it’s not going to be an easy race and, you know, of course, got some really quick guys around me. We don’t know if it’s going to be a one-stop or a two-stop, so it won’t be straightforward.
||
Q: After what happened in Spain last time out, do you feel you can lean on Max going into Turn 1?
||
GR: Yeah. I think, obviously, we’re both fighting for the win here, and neither of us are really in a championship battle. I haven’t had a win this year, so I want to get one on the board. Time will tell.
||
Q: Max, let’s bring it to you. Great qualifying session for you as well. Was there anything left in the car or the lap that could have made a difference in Q3?
||
MV: No.
||
Q: Talk us through the session then. It seemed to get better and better. Certainly that run in Q3, Sector 1 in particular.
||
MV: It was fine. I mean, I made progress every qualifying. We planned it with a Medium like that, and everything worked well. So I’m happy with that.
||
Q: Let’s throw it forward then. How racy does the car feel over a long stint?
||
MV: It felt okay yesterday. I mean, I was fairly happy with the car. You just need to look after the tyres. There was a bit of graining for everyone yesterday, so we’ll try to keep that under control for tomorrow, also with the warmer temperatures.
||
Q: You said a moment ago that a solid race is what you're looking for tomorrow. What does that mean for you?
||
MV: I think being on the podium, trying to be as competitive as we can be, trying to extract the most out of the car. But I don’t know. We’ll probably find out after the race if we did so. But, yeah, hopefully we can just be good on tyre management.
||
Q: And, Max, the penalty points thing, you're alongside George...
||
MV: I don’t need to hear it again. It’s really pissing me off. I mean, you were speaking about it on Thursday. It’s such a waste of time. It’s very childish. So, that’s why I also don’t want to say too much because it’s really annoying, this world that we live in.

||
Q: Okay. No change from you. Good luck. Well done today. Oscar, let’s come to you now. Great job as well. How do you sum up qualifying from your point of view?
||
OP: Much better than practice, that’s for sure. I mean, honestly, I’m quite happy here in P3. After all the practice sessions, I was struggling, obviously. I didn’t have a smooth session this morning, and, yeah, everything just felt more back to normal. In qualifying, everything came alive again. So, you know, there’ll always be the question—should we have gone for a Medium at the end? But I think with how we’d been going in practice, having just a clean run on the same compound seemed like the best idea for us, and honestly, I think it worked well. So honestly, pretty happy.
||
Q: Can you just elaborate on the decision not to take the Medium? How close was it? Was it a live decision? Did you make that call just before Q3? Or was it something that you decided before the session?
||
OP: I mean, we always kept it on the table, but I don’t think we were ever that—or I certainly wasn’t ever that tempted. Like I said, practice was pretty miserable. So, I just wanted to have a clean run through qualifying, not introduce any variables that could have made things even more difficult. That’s what we stuck to. I think it’s been a strength of ours so far this year—sticking to our guns and doing what we think is best for us. Would we have been on pole position on a Medium? Maybe. But there’s also the risk that it goes wrong, and you end up worse than we are now. So, I’m pretty happy.
||
Q: The car came alive for you in qualifying. You just said that. Can you challenge these guys for the win?
||
OP: I think so. Again, Friday didn’t look great in any run, but I certainly feel more comfortable now than I did this morning and then yesterday. Our pace on race days is generally where we’re strong. These two next to me were very quick in the race runs yesterday, so it’s certainly not going to be a slam dunk win, but I think we’re definitely in the fight.
||
QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR
||
Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) George, you’ve talked up McLaren’s pace quite a lot this season. Are you surprised that you're going into tomorrow's race with a real chance of fighting against Oscar, or what are you expecting versus McLaren tomorrow?
||
GR: I think, as I mentioned before, it really depends on these temperatures. At the moment, the tyres aren’t really overheating. And any circuits we go to where the tyres aren’t overheating, such as here, such as Vegas last year, we performed really well. McLaren—you know, we saw them yesterday—they were really on the back foot. So, it depends tomorrow. It’s something literally as simple as it clouding over that could give us a two-tenths advantage over McLaren. If the sun comes out, that sort of neutralises everything. I’d love to say something more than that—it’s a little bit out of our hands right now. But regardless of the conditions, we’re obviously starting in the best place.
||
Q: (Edd Straw – The Race) Oscar, you had the option to run the suspension upgrade but decided not to. Can you explain the reasoning, and is that a part you expect to help you in the future?
||
OP: I’m not that concerned really. I’m obviously not going to get into too much detail on it, but I could have run it if I wanted to, and I didn’t really. It changes some things—some things are better, some things are worse. It’s not as simple. It’s not an upgrade, it’s a different part. So, yeah, I had the option to run it but chose not to. I’ve been happy with how the car’s been so far this year and, again, just wanted to keep consistency.
||
Q: (Mark Mann-Bryans – Autosport) George, with your GPDA hat on maybe, question about Derek Warwick being suspended from stewarding. Should stewards be allowed to talk to the media or is that a conflict of interest?
||
GR: You know, we’re obviously all open to have our own views. I think what Derek said—I don’t think it probably offended anybody. Hence why we’re going to see him back. Principally, I think these days every word you say gets scrutinised, and that’s just the nature of the game we’re in. We also have to remember the stewards are volunteers. They don’t make an income from stewarding. They have a life outside of Formula 1 as well. We all speak to media in the paddock. So, yeah, if it was anything more than his sort of temporary—not ban—but his temporary avoidance of stewarding this weekend, I think anything more than that would’ve been a bit OTT. So yeah.
||
Q: (Stu Cowan – Montreal Gazette). George, is there anything you learned from starting on pole here last year that can help you tomorrow?
||
GR: Yeah. I mean, well, one thing—you know, in Montreal, you just can’t discount the weather or things happening on track. It’s a street track. You’ve got to fight until the last lap of the race. And, yeah, last year was a poor race for me, and I felt it could’ve gone differently. So obviously I’ll be doing my best to make up for last year’s losses. But it’s totally different this year. As we said before, we don’t know how the race is going to pan out because the hard tyre is the one that we’re all going to use at some point in the race, and no one knows if that would do the distance to give you a one-stop or not. So, there’s that curveball in there.
||
Q: (Sahil Kapur – NBC) Max, after Spain, you sounded a little bit downbeat on your championship hopes. Was that just heat of the moment? And after a day like today, do you feel like you’re still in it?
||
MV: No, I ust go race by race. I don’t really look at that at all. I mean, even when I was in the championship fight or leading, you’re not consistently thinking about it. Just race by race. Try to always maximise everything. Try to do the best you can.
||
Q: (Celini Ehret – MotorsInside.com) George, Montreal always tests braking stability. How much confidence did you have on the brakes today, especially on Turn 10?
||
GR: Yeah. Clearly feeling pretty good in the car. Always in these cooler conditions, it performs really well. Even… we’re just comparing shoe sizes here. I struggle to get these in the car. Yeah. So, I’m lost now to where I was.
||
MV: That’s why you’re breaking is so good?
||
GR: Yeah. That’s why—look at these! You know, braking is no issue whatsoever. So, yeah, absolutely. No. As I said, when it is cooler, the car feels great, and it gives me that confidence. And even throughout the course of Q3, over the course of qualifying, you know, from the start to the end with all the red flags, it was probably an hour and 15 minutes or so. The track cools down in that period, and it’s no shock that we were quicker in Q3 than we were in Q1. That is something we are, as a team, doing our utmost to try and improve because, of course, we take the benefits from today, but not every race is like today. And we probably have three races where our car is in the sweet spot. But it’s a 24-race season, and we need to find some improvements for the rest of the season.
||
Q: (Ticiano Figueiredo – Diário do Rio Claro). Max, you've been driving close to perfection this week and pushing hard. You're known for being mentally strong under pressure. How much of this performance would you attribute to improvements in the car, and how much is just you being in the zone?
||
MV: Well, I mean, the car has been the same as Barcelona, but I do think the team did a great job. When we arrived, the car was immediately in the right window. So setup-wise, I think the team did a very good job. And then, of course, it’s fine-tuning little bits and choosing the right tyres for qualifying. But overall, I’ve been fairly happy with the car, which has definitely been a bit more hit and miss for us this season. I think we just also need to focus on the overall performance that we maybe are lacking sometimes. But also sometimes we are chasing the balance of the car. So it’s two different things. But this weekend, I felt good, and that’s why I’m also very happy, honestly, to be here today in qualifying.
||
Q: (Nate Saunders – ESPN) Question for George and Oscar first . I know the penalty point situation got mentioned. Just how different is it to fight a driver when you know that risk is in play? And, Max, again, I’ve got to ask, I know you responded to it earlier, do you feel any different going into a race like this with that hanging over your head? Do you feel under more pressure than normal?
||
Q: (Nate Saunders – ESPN) Then to the other two—George and Oscar?
||
GR: I don’t think any driver goes out looking to crash into somebody and get penalty points on your licence. Max is one of the best drivers. There’s no reason for him to race any differently, and I’m not sitting here thinking he’s going to give us more room. If anything, probably the opposite to try and prove a point. So I’ll be keeping an eye, but ultimately, we’re all here to win. You’re not going to do something that’s going to jeopardise yourself from the race. It’s a busy season as well. If you get a race ban, you get a race ban and spend some time at home. It’s not ideal, but it’s not the end of the world.
||
OP: I think for me, I’m not going to race any differently. I’m not going to take any less risk, any more risk. I’m certainly not going to do anything different. I’ll race as I always race.
||
Q: (Rodrigo França – Car Magazine Brazil) Question to Oscar Piastri. Oscar, we saw a very different weekend for McLaren this season. It’s been dominance for the team. Do you think it’s the characteristic of Montreal, or have Mercedes, Red Bull, and Ferrari closed the gap?
||
OP: I think we have struggled so far this weekend. In qualifying, we found our feet a bit more, and it became a little bit more normal. But apart from maybe one or two races in qualifying, it’s been very close a lot of the time. Today, you had the added complication of the Medium tyre versus the Soft. And like George was saying, it’s a track where they’ve been strong in the past. The conditions maybe suited them more. There’s a thousand reasons it could be. But yesterday, we were on the back foot. Even this morning for myself in particular—I was not particularly happy. In qualifying, I think it’s just the kind of normal battle. That’s a bit of the price you pay for not being on top of things from the start. You miss that extra half a tenth maybe, and that can be the difference. That’s more or less what it was today. Obviously the gap was bigger than that, but again, with some other factors in there, I think we were in the mix but paid the price for a slightly messy weekend.

"['oscar-piastri', 'lando-norris']","['Oscar Piastri', 'Lando Norris']",Norris reflects on ‘worst Friday of the year’ while Piastri insists there are ‘no alarm bells’ as McLaren look for improvements in Canada,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/norris-reflects-on-worst-friday-of-the-year-while-piastri-insists-there-are.3xGAWzPJ8Pm5I39StfShZC,McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have given their take on how their Friday went at the Canadian Grand Prix.,"Lando Norris has labelled his “tricky” opening day of action at the Canadian Grand Prix as the “worst Friday of the year” for McLaren, with team mate Oscar Piastri also acknowledging that the squad are aiming to take a step forward in order to keep up with their rivals in Montreal.
||
On a weekend in which the team have brought upgrades to the MCL39, Norris and Piastri ended Free Practice 1 in seventh and 14th on the timesheets respectively, while the day’s second practice hour saw Norris finish second behind Mercedes’ George Russell with Piastri in sixth.
||
FP2: Russell narrowly leads Norris and Antonelli in Canada after Stroll strikes the wall
||
Reflecting on how the new parts feel on the car so far, Norris admitted that it was difficult to get a read during the first day of running at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve.
||
“[They feel] pretty similar, honestly, but I think it’s more it’s hard to say just from one track,” the Briton explained. “I think you have to go to many more, especially here it’s quite unique with the amount of bumps and kerbs and low grip that we have.
||
“So a bit too early to tell, but all of the things are aiming to move the car in the right direction and give me more feeling, which is a good thing. But I would say a tricky day, probably one of the trickiest we’ve had this year.
||
“A little bit off the pace comparing to some of the others, and maybe it didn’t look it at the end but [it was] just difficult to ever put a lap together and be consistent – I did one good lap the whole session. We have some work to do.”
||
AS IT HAPPENED: Follow the action from FP2 for the Canadian GP
||
When pushed on what the issues may have been down to, Norris continued: “I think we need to get the car in a better place. It’s been our most difficult and everyone’s in the same boat on the track.
||
“The track’s difficult but it’s definitely been our worst Friday of the year, I would say so far – not worst in the pace, but most difficult to put together and most tricky. We’re not miles away, just need to make it a little bit easier to drive.”
||
Despite this, Norris is still optimistic about McLaren’s prospects entering into Qualifying day on Saturday but remains wary of the threat posed by the likes of Mercedes, who claimed pole position at the track in 2024 with Russell.
||
“I think we’re still in a good position, it’s just that it’s close – there’s all the teams up there,” the 25-year-old said. “Mercedes now seem very, very quick, just as they were last year here – they were quite easily the best last year. We expected them to be fast, they proved that today.
||

||
“But I’m complaining that I’m not first really! We’re still there or thereabouts, it’s just trying to simplify things a little bit, trying to make the car a bit easier to drive. We’ll be there or thereabouts, at the minute I wouldn’t say we’re the quickest but you never know.”
||
On the other side of the garage, Piastri also suggested that the papaya squad have room to improve but reflected positively on his progression throughout Friday’s sessions.
||
“It definitely ended better than it started, but I think still some improvements to try and make,” the Australian conceded. “It’s been a little bit of a tricky day, just trying to find the right window of the car. I think we’re getting there but we still need to find a bit more.
||
“The competition looks close, also just knowing what tyres to use is an interesting discussion at the moment, so I’m sure we’ll see how we can find a bit more tomorrow.”
||

||
In terms of where the understanding is with the updates – and how hopeful he feels about making an additional step on Saturday – Piastri added: “I think the new parts have done what we expected them to, but hopefully we can find a bit more.
||
“I think we made a good step from FP1 to FP2, and just need to try and make the same step again, I guess. No alarm bells, just trying to get the car in a better window and get me in a better window.”

Ahead of the Canadian Grand Prix this weekend, Norris was asked whether an intra-team fight was inevitable as the season progresses, with it looking likely one of the McLaren drivers will claim the title.
||
""We never said we're going to avoid everything,"" said Norris. ""I think we've actually been quite open in saying at some point, something is probably going to happen.
||
""We just have to be ready for that. I think both Oscar and myself know that, we're competitive, we want to beat each other but the main thing is we stay strong together as a team. But everything is in the open, everything is obvious, everything is known between us.
||
""We both want to win, we both want to beat each other, but at the end of the day there can only be one person and that will be whoever performs the best over the course of the year.
||
""I think Andrea [Stella, McLaren Team Principal] said it, it's not an 'if', it's a 'when' and we'll see when that time comes. But of course we'll try and avoid everything as much as possible but it's inevitable that it happens in racing.""

||
Going into the race weekend in Montreal Piastri has taken five wins this season, and only finished off the podium once in nine races, while Norris has taken just two wins.
||
Norris believes his team mate has ""improved in most areas"" compared with last season and that he needs to raise his own performances to challenge for the title over the remaining 15 races.
||
""He's in his third season of F1, I remember in my third season you just come into the year a little bit more confident and with a bit more knowledge and just a more complete driver,"" the Briton said.

""That's what he's done and he's performing well, he's driving incredibly well and at a very high level and deserves everything he's been doing at the minute. It's a good fun rivalry between us.""
||
Piastri, meanwhile, believes that his battle with Norris stretches beyond this current season and that maintaining a strong relationship will be key for years to come.
||
""Clearly there's competition and there's a 'want to beat each other on track' [mentality] but we've said before, we don't want just one opportunity to try and win a world championship each,"" said Piastri in Canada.

||
After setting the pace in the Q1 and Q2 segments of the session, Piastri initially looked to have secured provisional pole during the opening runs of Q3 – before Norris went even faster, having taken a tow from his team mate in the final corner.

When warned over the radio that Norris would pass him after crossing the line, Piastri dryly responded: “Cheeky”. Piastri went on to beat his team mate in the second runs, securing his fourth pole position of the season.
||
However, when asked later in the weekend – after a race in which Piastri led home Norris in a 1-2 result – about how much that Qualifying moment had acted as a reminder of the intra-team challenges McLaren could face during the rest of the season, Stella played down its significance and suggested that the onus was more on the squad’s communication.

“It was a minor situation,” the team boss explained. “We always tell our drivers like, ‘Don’t leave anything in the back of your mind, anything, throw it out, say what you think’. In this case I think that Oscar’s comment was to highlight a situation that we didn’t discuss before.
||
“In itself it’s not anything too controversial, but we sort of did not discuss that before and we don’t want to surprise our drivers with situations that we didn’t discuss before, so a little bit to take on for the team rather than for the drivers.
||
PALMER: How Oscar Piastri turned his weaknesses into strengths and became the championship favourite
||
“We have to do some homework and be ready even more for the coming races, which surely will be interesting.”
||
Stella also insisted that he does not expect the team’s pre-race briefings to become more difficult to handle, even if Piastri and Norris continue to find themselves battling each other at the front of the pack.
||
“The briefing is not getting like tougher,” said Stella. “The conversations are the same that we always have.
||
POWER RANKINGS: Who impressed our judges across a dramatic Spanish Grand Prix weekend?
||
“Obviously when the two drivers start one next to each other and there is 800 metres to corner one, you might have to reiterate every detail of the way we go racing together, but so far I just can only be very grateful to Lando and Oscar, who have approached this internal competition with a great sense of responsibility and pretty much sticking to the letter to what are our racing principles and approach.”

||
Norris started the encounter in third position, behind polesitting Red Bull rival Max Verstappen and team mate Oscar Piastri, but rose to the fore as conditions changed between torrential rain and bright sunshine.
||
While his route to the top step of the podium was aided by Verstappen’s spin amid a mid-race Safety Car and Piastri’s 10-second penalty for his driving at the restart, Norris did not put a foot wrong and lapped up the applause from the home fans as he closed in on the chequered flag.
||
“The last few laps I was just looking into the crowd,” said Norris. “I was just trying got take it all in, enjoy the moment, because it might never happen again. I hope it does, but these are memories that I’ll bring with me forever so – an incredible achievement.”
||
Given the changeable conditions, the challenge of keeping his car pointing in the right direction and the various incidents unfolding around him, Norris continued: “In terms of being a stressful race, this is as stressful as you can get.
||
“I mean, it was a good race for Oscar as well. I’ve got to give my credits to Oscar, he was fast the whole way. So, yeah, a round of applause for Oscar.
||
“He put up a good fight and I enjoy those moments together when we’re on track. Not as much when he’s ahead of me as when he’s behind, but that’s life. Credit to him and of course McLaren.
||
“To win at home in front of all the friends and family that we have here is pretty amazing, so a big thanks to them.”
||
Norris’ victory means he has cut Piastri’s championship lead from 15 points to eight, with a mini break coming up before drivers return to action at the Belgian Grand Prix over the weekend of July 25-27.

['lando-norris'],['Lando Norris'],Norris hails ‘perfect result’ after victory in Austria as he reflects on ‘tough’ battle with Piastri,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/norris-hails-perfect-result-after-victory-in-austria-as-he-reflects-on-tough.3z48pUzkW8JEeJpWPEbP9x,Lando Norris was delighted to take victory at the Austrian Grand Prix following a close battle with McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri.,"Lando Norris was delighted to lead a McLaren 1-2 with his victory at the Austrian Grand Prix, which came following a “tough” race-long battle with team mate Oscar Piastri that caused the Briton “a lot of stress”.
||
Both papaya cars made a good start when the race got underway at the Red Bull Ring, Norris maintaining his lead from pole position while Piastri took a position from Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc to move up into P2.
||
A thrilling scrap then ensued across the opening stint which saw Piastri make several attempts at overtaking Norris. The Australian briefly got ahead at one stage, only for the other McLaren to quickly surge back in front.
||
The fight started to heat up again during the final stages of the 70-lap encounter, but Norris managed to maintain enough of a gap to seal his third win of the season, crossing the line 2.695s clear of Piastri.
||
Asked after jumping out of the car about how he had handled the pressure throughout the race – which took place in hot conditions in Spielberg – Norris admitted that it had not been an easy afternoon at the wheel of the MCL39.
||
“It was a tough race,” the 25-year-old conceded. “Pushing the whole way through. [It was] tricky, hot, tiring, but a perfect result for us a team – a 1-2 is exactly what we want and we did it again, so I’m very happy.”
||
The result marked a strong turnaround for Norris following the nightmare end to his race last time out in Canada, in which he collided with Piastri during the closing laps and was forced to retire from the running.
||
This time the intra-team duel remained clean, but Norris acknowledged that Piastri gave him quite a tough challenge throughout the event in Austria.
||
“We had a great battle, that’s for sure,” the British driver said. “It was a lot of fun, for me a lot of stress but a lot of fun! A nice battle, so well done to Oscar.
||
“Hopefully it was a nice one for everyone to watch, but inside the car it was obviously tough, especially when he was in DRS. The DRS is so big around here, it’s hard to get him out of the gap, but once I did I could manage things pretty well. But he was still quick, so it was good fun.”
||
Norris’ victory means that his gap to leader Piastri in the Drivers’ Championship now stands at 15 points ahead of McLaren’s upcoming home race at Silverstone on July 4-6.

||
Norris converted pole position into the lead at Turn 1 but soon came under intense pressure from championship leader Piastri, who launched several attacks and at one point muscled his way past, only for the positions to be swiftly reversed.
||
After a particularly close call under braking for Turn 4, which saw Piastri lock up and almost run into the back of Norris, the Australian went slightly longer on his starting set of tyres in an attempt to build an advantage for the remainder of the race.
||
While Piastri lit up the timesheets in phases across the second and third stints, Norris had just enough pace in hand to hold onto P1 and take the chequered flag – marking his third win of the season and first victory since last month’s Monaco Grand Prix.

FORMULA 1 MSC CRUISES AUSTRIAN GRAND PRIX 2025
||
In the absence of team boss Fred Vasseur, who travelled home pre-race for “personal reasons”, the upgraded Ferraris had quiet but fruitful races en route to a podium with Charles Leclerc and fourth-place result with Lewis Hamilton.
||
George Russell was the sole Mercedes finisher in fifth, with rookie team mate Kimi Antonelli dramatically running into Verstappen under braking for Turn 3 on the opening lap – eliminating both drivers from the action. The stewards later gave Antonelli a three-place grid penalty for his next race.
||
Liam Lawson capitalised to convert his top-six grid slot into a top-six finish, ahead of Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso and Kick Sauber’s Bortoleto, who scored his first F1 points after a monumental scrap with the two-time World Champion.
||
A strong recovery from the back of the grid brought a third successive points finish for Nico Hulkenberg, and gave Sauber a double points reward, while Esteban Ocon rounded out the top 10 places for Haas.
||
Ollie Bearman followed team mate Ocon home in 11th, with Isack Hadjar 12th in the other Racing Bulls machine and Pierre Gasly dropping from points contention to 13th amid severe balance problems aboard his Alpine.
||
Next up was Lance Stroll, whose eye-catching practice pace could not be carried over to Qualifying or the race, while Franco Colapinto (Alpine) and Yuki Tsunoda (Red Bull) were the final drivers to cross the finish line.
||
Colapinto came close to contact with Piastri in the closing stages of the race when the McLaren man was putting a lap on him, an incident that earned the F1 returnee a five-second penalty but did not impact his finishing position.
||
Tsunoda was hit with a 10-second penalty of his own for sending Colapinto into a spin earlier in the race, with Verstappen and Antonelli joined on the sidelines by Williams drivers Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz – the latter unable to start after getting stuck on the grid.
||
Following that dramatic clash with team mate Piastri in Canada last time out, Norris came back fighting when he hit the track at the Red Bull Ring – the Briton displaying rapid pace through practice before charging his way to pole position in Qualifying.
||
Norris ended Q3 a whopping half a second clear of nearest rival Leclerc, with Piastri having to settle for third after being hindered by yellow flags on his final run, and reigning World Champion Verstappen also losing out to the caution down in seventh.
||
As the anticipated two-stop race approached, amid rising air and track temperatures, it was revealed that the majority of the field would be starting on medium tyres, with Gasly, Hadjar, Colapinto, Bearman and Hulkenberg opting for softs.
||
There was drama on the formation lap, though, with Sainz struggling to pull away from his P19 grid slot and getting left behind. “The car is stuck in first gear,” the Spaniard said over the radio, before he eventually drove off while Race Control abandoned the start.
||
Another formation lap followed some 10 minutes later, with Sainz sadly unable to take the start after returning his Williams to the pit lane, where it overheated. Alonso also noted the high temperatures, reporting that his seat felt like it was “200 degrees”.
||
When the race eventually began, Norris made a strong enough getaway to retain his pole advantage into Turn 1, while Piastri swept around the outside of Leclerc for P2 and Russell went wheel-to-wheel with the Ferraris.
||
As the field roared towards Turn 3, where Norris covered off Piastri, more drama ensued when Antonelli lost control of his Mercedes under braking and slammed into Verstappen’s car – putting both drivers out of the race. Lawson was fortunate to avoid being a third retirement.
||
“I got hit like crazy,” a sweary Verstappen rued over the radio, as Antonelli admitted he simply “lost the rear”. With the Dutchman and Italian debriefing at the side of the track, the Safety Car was brought out to allow marshals to clear the track.
||
On Lap 3 of 70, Bernd Maylander peeled back into the pits and released the remaining 17 drivers – Norris handling the situation well to hold the lead over Piastri, Leclerc, Hamilton, Russell and Gasly, with a fast-starting Albon up to seventh.
||
“Lewis just closed the door under braking,” argued Russell over the radio after a failed move on the seven-time World Champion for fourth at Turn 4, with several drivers engaging in battle but no more incidents occurring for the time being.
||
Turn 4 was the scene for another heart-in-mouth moment a couple of laps later when Piastri – having remained within a second of his team mate – used the Drag Reduction System to get perilously close. “Your call on the racing situation,” came a follow-up message from the Australian’s race engineer.
||
With Gasly’s soft tyres seemingly degrading, Albon continued his progress thanks to a clean move for sixth place under braking for Turn 3. The Frenchman would soon come under pressure from Bortoleto, Lawson and Alonso in the remaining top 10 spots.
||
On Lap 11, the lead battle kicked off again when Piastri used DRS to grab the lead from Norris into Turn 3. A lock-up at the apex left the door ajar, though, and Norris duly reclaimed P1 with a switchback on the run to Turn 4, where Piastri snatched a brake once more.
||
As the laps ticked by, Piastri remained glued to Norris’ gearbox, having several sniffs at another overtake but not quite managing to find a way past. How much longer could his starting set of tyres hold on while running in the dirty air of his team mate?
||
Elsewhere, Bearman, Gasly, Hadjar, Hulkenberg and Colapinto were all early stoppers as tyre strategies began to play out, while Williams’ day went from bad to worse when Albon was called back to the pits to retire amid apparent technical trouble.
||
Lap 20 brought another flashpoint in a tense battle between Norris and Piastri, with the latter locking up heavily into Turn 4 and almost running into the back of his team mate. Norris subsequently took to the pit lane for a fresh set of tyres, while Piastri continued on his way.
||
“Let’s see your pace in free air now,” was the message to Piastri, who opted to continue on his way rather than immediately respond to Norris – albeit with a sizeable flat spot. “The data looks OK to continue,” his engineer subsequently confirmed.
||
Piastri decided that enough was enough at the end of Lap 24 and pitted for his own set of fresh hard tyres, coming back out some 5.5 seconds behind Norris. Leclerc and Hamilton pitted shortly afterwards, meaning McLaren were now back in their 1-2 positions.
||
As the race settled down again, with Norris further extending his lead to 6.5 seconds, Piastri’s engineer gave him some “feedback” from the McLaren pit wall. “The manoeuvre in Turn 4 with the front lock-up was too marginal,” he warned.
||
Splitting the Ferraris of Leclerc and Hamilton, fourth-placed Lawson and fifth-placed Alonso were now the only drivers yet to pit. With new tyres at his disposal, Hamilton soon worked his way past both drivers – including a bold move on the outside of Lawson at Turn 6.
||
Then came more drama at Turn 4 when Tsunoda, having already engaged in battle with Stroll, tipped Colapinto into a spin. That forced the Japanese driver back to the pits for a new front wing, while Colapinto lost ground.
||
It was not much better for the other Alpine of Gasly, who was valiantly holding onto a points-paying position but faced huge problems in the cockpit. “I have no grip... I’m about to spin every corner,” he shouted over the radio, with a swear word for good measure.
||
Tsunoda was promptly given a 10-second penalty for the incident with Colapinto, before stops from Lawson and Alonso at the halfway mark meant every driver had now pitted – those two seemingly on course for the alternate one-stop approach.
||
With 35 laps to run, Norris led Piastri by 5.3 seconds. Leclerc sat around 14 seconds further back in third, from Hamilton, Russell and squabbling Kick Sauber pair Bortoleto and Hulkenberg (who had charged forward with that early stop and some undercutting). Haas duo Ocon and Bearman were eighth and ninth, with Gasly – who was losing ground amid ongoing issues – circulating in 10th.
||
Lawson and Alonso sat just outside the points following their stops, but with the prospect of making up some places as rivals pitted for a second time, while Hadjar, Colapinto, Stroll and the penalised Tsunoda brought up the rear.
||
Back at the front, Piastri was starting to put Norris under pressure again, reducing his team mate’s advantage to three seconds with that tyre delta. “He’s mainly quicker in high-speed,” Norris was told, along with some time loss through traffic.
||
Norris gained a bit of breathing space a few laps later when Piastri ran wide at Turn 1 and clattered the kerbs, while Hamilton’s hopes of cutting the gap to team mate Leclerc and challenging for a podium were dented by a similar mistake at Turn 3.
||
With the two-stoppers cycling through their final tyre changes, radio messages picked up Hamilton commenting that “I don’t want to stop”, having reported that his rubber felt fine. No positions were lost when he returned to the track, at least.
||
Norris was next in on Lap 52, followed by Piastri one tour later – both drivers taking on medium tyres and the positions remaining unchanged. The gap between the papaya cars now stood at 3.5 seconds, with a potential grandstand finish in store.
||
However, Piastri’s efforts to cut Norris’ lead were hampered by traffic. With Colapinto and Tsunoda battling for position at Turn 3, the Argentinian wildly cut back across the track and forced Piastri onto the grass – earning him a five-second penalty.
||
From there, Norris managed the gap back to Piastri and calmly worked his way through more traffic – which involved Alonso and Bortoleto’s feisty exchange – to seal the deal and bag the win, cutting his team mate’s championship advantage to 15 points.
||
Leclerc completed the podium over Hamilton, followed by Russell, a high-flying Lawson and Alonso, who narrowly beat Bortoleto to seventh via some brilliant late racing but could not take the shine off the Brazilian’s maiden F1 points finish.
||
Hulkenberg and Ocon were the final points scorers in ninth and 10th, from Bearman, Hadjar, Gasly and Stroll, with the penalised Colapinto and Tsunoda the final classified drivers at the end of their bruising afternoons behind the wheel.
||
As mentioned above, Verstappen and Antonelli both watched the race from the paddock after their first-lap collision, while Williams suffered one of their worst days of the season thanks to Albon and Sainz’s double elimination.
||
“It was a tough race, pushing the whole way through – tricky, hot, tiring – but a perfect result for us a team,” said Norris. “A 1-2 is exactly what we want and we did it again, so I’m very happy. We [me and Piastri] had a great battle, that’s for sure. It was a lot of fun – for me a lot of stress, but a lot of fun! A nice battle, so well done to Oscar. Hopefully it was a nice one for everyone to watch, but inside the car it was obviously tough, especially when he was in DRS. The DRS [effect] is so big around here, it’s hard to get him out of the gap, but once I did I could manage things pretty well. He was still quick, so it was good fun.”

||
The start was initially aborted as Carlos Sainz – who reported issues with his Williams when he exited Q1 on Saturday – found himself stuck on the grid at the beginning of the formation lap. While he eventually got going, his return to the pits prompted a fairly intense fire around his rear brakes and he was forced to retire straight away.
||
At lights out, Norris and Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc both got a good launch, but the lead McLaren was able to fend off the Monegasque’s challenge heading into the first corner. This allowed Oscar Piastri, who started from P3, to charge past Leclerc and claim second place on track.
||
Further back, Kimi Antonelli locked up and drove straight forward into Verstappen, resulting in both being stranded on the circuit and retiring from the race as the Safety Car appeared while their their cars were recovered.

||
Norris is firmly in the mix for the world title this season, splitting team mate Oscar Piastri and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen in the Drivers’ Championship after 10 rounds, but he has come under the spotlight for making mistakes at crunch moments.
||
That includes several compromised Q3 performances, the most notable being a heavy crash in Saudi Arabia, while he ran into the back of Piastri’s car on race day last time out in Montreal, which eliminated the Briton from the race and cost him valuable points.
||
However, Norris appears to have put that latest disappointment firmly behind him during the break between races – dominating practice at the Red Bull Ring and then charging his way to a comfortable pole despite missing FP1.
||
Asked after Qualifying where that performance came from, having last been on pole in Monaco three races ago, Norris smiled: “It was a good lap, that’s for sure. I guess just little bit by little bit.
||
“I feel even like my Q3 run one was good, but I knew there were a few places where if I just got it right I could get still quite a bit more time – and I did exactly that. I did what I planned to do, and when I plan to do something and it goes right, it normally goes very, very well.
||
“I’m very happy, [it’s been] a good day, and it’s been a good weekend for me so far, so hopefully we can keep it up.”
||
Put to him that he was not showing a huge amount of emotion over the result, and instead appears to have adopted a “steely focus” this weekend, Norris replied: “I don’t know. I’m still very happy. It’s just that it’s a long season.
||
“I still savour this moment, especially because some of my tougher moments have been in Quali. To put in a lap like today, to have the performance throughout this weekend like I’ve had, is pleasing for myself.
||
“I’m excited. It’s a long race tomorrow. It’s more that it’s just a long season. I’m very happy with today, but I want to prove it to myself over and over again, and hopefully this is just the beginning of it.”
||
Norris will head into Sunday’s race 22 points behind Piastri, who lines up third, and 21 points ahead of Verstappen, who lines up seventh – his title rivals compromised by yellow flags in the decisive Q3 phase.

The Briton, who missed FP1 as his McLaren seat was taken by F2 championship leader Alex Dunne, was immediately up to speed on Friday afternoon despite a lack of earlier running.
||
His 1m 04.580s left him 0.157s clear of Piastri and was almost a second faster than George Russell's best from earlier in the day.
||
Max Verstappen completed the top three ahead of Lance Stroll's Aston Martin and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who also missed FP1 as Dino Beganovic drove his car.

||
A couple of hours on from an initial outing topped by George Russell and Mercedes, who claimed pole position and victory last time out in Canada, the 20-strong field had another 60 minutes to dial in their cars through an increasingly overcast but warm and dry FP2.
||
Back in action after Alex Dunne’s eye-catching FP1 run, Lando Norris soon stated his intentions when the session began by clocking a 1m 05.437s on medium tyres, putting him just ahead of Russell (softs), Verstappen (softs) and Piastri (hards) at the one-third mark.
||
Elsewhere, there was some drama for Charles Leclerc, who also missed first practice and went for a trip through the gravel at Turn 6, while Kimi Antonelli had to take avoiding action when he approached a slow-moving Lewis Hamilton at Turn 4.

||
As the session developed and every driver pumped in laps on the red-marked soft rubber, Norris maintained his superiority with a 1m 04.580s – a tenth-and-a-half quicker than Piastri and three-tenths faster than Verstappen, who used two fresh sets.
||
Continuing to bounce back from wrist surgery, Lance Stroll impressed en route to fourth position for Aston Martin, from Leclerc, Russell and the sister Red Bull of Yuki Tsunoda, whose best lap put him within four-tenths of team mate Verstappen.
||
Kick Sauber rookie Gabriel Bortoleto was another driver to make their mark with a run to eighth, just in front of Fernando Alonso’s Aston Martin and Hamilton, who lamented to his engineer over the radio that “for some reason I’ve just got no pace, mate”.
||
Antonelli wound up just outside the top-10 places, followed by the Racing Bulls of Liam Lawson – who had to return to the pits early on thanks to his steering wheel “pulling me massively to the right” – and Isack Hadjar.
||
Pierre Gasly was the first driver with a deficit of more than a second to pace-setter Norris in another ultra-close session, taking 14th in his Alpine over the Haas and Williams machines – Esteban Ocon leading Alex Albon, Carlos Sainz and Ollie Bearman.
||
Fresh from points-scoring runs in Spain and Canada, it was a quieter practice session for Nico Hulkenberg, who was around half a second slower than Sauber team mate Bortoleto in 19th.
||
Hulkenberg reported over the radio that “I’m not feeling the love” from the car as the chequered flag approached, leaving the German ahead of only Alpine’s Franco Colapinto on the FP2 timing screen.
||
Drivers and teams will now regroup in the Red Bull Ring paddock to dig through the data and ponder set-up changes before the third and final practice session, which is due to begin at 1230 local time on Saturday.

['lando-norris'],['Lando Norris'],TECH WEEKLY: The ingenious changes McLaren have made to help Norris re-find his mojo,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/tech-weekly-the-ingenious-changes-mclaren-have-made-to-help-norris-re-find.3WYpLDUx9pBNKUvgHKrfhA,"While Lando Norris has struggled for feel in the 2025 McLaren, the team may just have found the solution...","Have McLaren developed a solution to Lando Norris’ car feel problems that he’s reported since the start of the season? For the first time we can now see the visual difference between the standard McLaren front suspension and the ‘feedback enhanced’ version prepared for Norris in Canada, as can be seen in the Giorgio Piola drawing below.
||
This was in response to Norris’ complaints that he could not feel the front of the car in the same way he could with last year’s machine.
||
Speaking back during the Bahrain Grand Prix weekend, the Briton said: “Something’s just not clicking with me and the car. I’m not able to do any of the laps like I was doing last season.
||
""Then, I knew every single corner, everything that was going to happen with the car – how it was going to happen. I felt on top of the car. This year, I could not have felt more opposite so far.”
||
Piastri has expressed no such reservations and, although he tried the new specification suspension in practice at Montreal, he decided to remain with the standard system.
||
McLaren have been working on this revision for almost three months, but at a casual glance there is no obvious difference between the two suspensions.
||
The drawings show the crucial clue. The upper wishbones of the Norris version mount to the wheel with slightly thicker cross-sections than that of Piastri.
||
This is not in itself a change which would enhance the feedback to the steering, but it does correlate with a change which would – that of increasing the suspension’s king pin inclination.
||
What does this mean? The articulation of the wheel as it is steered is partly defined by how the wheel hub is angled from the vertical (as viewed from straight-on).
||
The difference between the straight line and the angle the hub is running is the king pin inclination.
||
The wheel will turn through a greater radius (called the scrub radius) the greater that angle is. This will give a greater difference in the weighting feedback through the steering as it is turned through different angles of lock.
||
If, as we suspect, Norris’ new suspension features a greater king pin inclination to enhance the steering feedback, it would place greater loads at the top of the suspension mounting, providing an explanation for why the top wishbones are slightly sturdier looking.
||
As ever, time will tell if it can help Norris recover what he feels he has lost in 2025 compared to last year as he looks to chase down his championship-leading team mate.

['lando-norris'],['Lando Norris'],HINCHCLIFFE: Norris broke one of motorsport’s golden rules – this is how McLaren must handle it,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/hinchcliffe-norris-broke-one-of-motorsports-golden-rules-this-is-how-mclaren.7Kgpfp5UvXNQ5C707rO0g3,IndyCar star and F1 TV pundit James Hinchcliffe gives an insight into what it's like behind the scenes when you have an incident with your team mate – and how the McLaren bosses must handle the fallout from Canada between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.,"There are two golden rules in motorsports: don’t hit your team mate on track, and don’t date your team mate’s sister. In my junior formula career I was guilty of the former. If we’re being fully transparent, I was guilty of the latter as well, but that’s a different story...
||
In the lower levels of the sport it is even more of an ‘every driver for themselves’ environment than it is at the professional level, so those incidents don’t carry many repercussions. In the main game, however, you are paid by the team and have to – to a large extent – understand that the team’s best interests come first.
||
Throughout the years, I’ve sat in many pre-race meetings with team owners when I’ve qualified near a team mate, and the ‘pep talks’ vary. There is the more traditional, modest approach, which goes something like: “you guys know what to do. Make sure you give each other room and don’t do anything that puts each other in a bad spot.”
||
Then there is the more forceful approach, which sounds something like: “You listen here – I’ve worked way too hard and spent way too much money for you two punks to go out and crash my cars and ruin a strong weekend!”
||
Then of course there is the passive-but-with-a-point method, where the boss says: “You’ve been starting next to team mates since karting. You know what to do, so I am not going to tell you. But we will be speaking later if this goes sideways…”
||
In F1, where team mates are so often starting close to one another given the natural hierarchical order of the grid, I imagine these conversations happen once or twice early in the year, and then not much has to be said after that. Unless, of course, two of them have already had an incident. But I will get to that later.
||
There have been plenty of close calls in my career, even a few minor contact moments that affected one or the other’s race and required a cool off period before business could resume as normal.
||
But those things happen in racing and one does well to have a short memory in this sport. I have only been involved in one stand out team mate-on-team mate crime as a professional (or at least, only one that I can remember).
||
That came when a team mate of mine pulled an overly optimistic move at an ill-advised part of a track. In fairness, the move wasn’t even on me, but I ended up being collateral damage, and we both ended up out in what was shaping up nicely to be a 1-2.
||
Our boss was none too happy. The drivers both agreed to disagree on who was at fault (and I believe still do to this day!), but it was the owners reaction that caught me off guard. He disappeared after the race and didn’t speak to either of us for two weeks. They were a long two weeks, I can tell you.
||
What happened in the Canadian Grand Prix between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri was widely viewed as an inevitability. It was never a matter of if, but rather when the two of them came together on track. This is something that McLaren signed up for when hiring two young, fast and highly capable drivers.
||
When a team isn’t fighting for the title, the pressure of having two stars isn’t as big a deal. When you’ve built a title-winning car, however, things get more complicated.
||
Teams can go the route of hiring the two best out there with hopes of pushing each other – think Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost at McLaren – or, you hire a clear number one and a great number two who can support a drivers bid while helping prop up the team’s constructors position. Think Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello at Ferrari.
||
Sometimes a team can even aim for the latter and end up with the former! (See Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton at McLaren in 2007). History has shown the former category often leads to a contentious environment.
||
McLaren might not have known they were signing up two drivers with ‘number one’ energy when they brought Piastri alongside Norris. There is also a good chance they didn’t know they’d be fighting for titles so quickly. Regardless, this is the situation they are now in and their reaction to it – and how they manage it – is crucial.
||
We’ve seen small flashes of this with the team’s ‘papaya rules’, but now we’ve had race-ending, points-losing contact on track. A team principal has to balance this dynamic carefully, I believe, by not siding with one driver or the other.
||
Norris put his hand up, so there was no real question of blame in this one, but even if there had been, remaining as neutral as possible is important.
||
Making sure that phrases like “you could’ve taken out Oscar!” need to be avoided. That tone can quickly make a driver think it is me vs them, and that usually only ends one way.
||
Conversely, no response – as my team owner in the above example opted for – is not the right response, either. Clear, open communication between team and drivers is the most effective way to keep both their drivers focused and happy to be on the team.
||
Having a competitive car and two winning drivers is a good problem to have, but if McLaren want it to stay that way for the long term, the next few months will be crucial.

But the Briton was left on the back foot in Q3, running wide at the final chicane with his first effort before putting in another attempt which left him with a 1m 11.625s.
||
While others, including polesitter George Russell and team mate Oscar Piastri improved with their final attempts, Norris failed to find time and will start seventh for Sunday's race.
||
The McLaren duo had also opted against using the medium compound of Pirelli tyre in the final stages, with Russell and Max Verstappen opting to use the C5 option instead of the soft C6 to lock out the front row.

When asked what might have been possible, he replied: ""Good enough for a top three, probably not good enough for pole.

""Hard to know how much was maybe the medium tyre performing that little bit better, especially when the grip comes up. Maybe the medium is a touch better but it was a gamble.

""It was a risk and I guess every team has their own opinion on what they thought was best and clearly we didn't think that was going to be better. But we did what we did and I just didn't put it together when I needed to.""

PRACTICE DEBRIEF: Can Mercedes stay on top or will McLaren bounce back in Canada?
||
One driver with plenty of work to do was Leclerc, who missed some 45 minutes of FP1 after crashing out and the entire FP2 session when Ferrari mechanics were forced to change the chassis on his SF-25.
||
Home favourite Lance Stroll also had lost mileage to make up for following the Aston Martin man’s shunt early in second practice, which disrupted an otherwise positive return to action in the wake of surgery on his wrist.

||
Amid questions over whether the soft or medium tyres will be the best option for Qualifying (the difference between Pirelli’s C5 and C6 compounds again appearing to be very small), the early minutes of final practice brought a range of run plans.
||
A quarter of the way into the hour-long session, it was Leclerc who led the way via a time of 1m 12.843s on the yellow-marked medium rubber, with Aston Martin pair Fernando Alonso and Stroll sitting a few tenths back on the red-marked soft.
||
AS IT HAPPENED: All the action from final practice for the Canadian Grand Prix
||
Drama then ensued as championship leader Piastri and Kick Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg had moments at the final chicane in quick succession – Piastri tagging the wall and picking up a puncture and Hulkenberg clipping it while completing a full spin.
||
After a brief spell under red flags that allowed marshals to clear away the debris that had been littered over the track, drivers were quick to head back out and resume their practice programmes, with Piastri and Hulkenberg forced to watch on from the sidelines.
||
As lap times tumbled, Russell took over at the top with a 1m 11.950s on softs, followed by Lewis Hamilton and Norris on mediums, while the soft-shod Max Verstappen slotted into fourth despite reporting that “I’m still lacking bite in the brake material”.
||
A final flurry of improvements on the soft tyres ended with Norris sitting at the top of the timing screen – his tidy 1m 11.799s effort just under a tenth up on the recovering Leclerc and another tenth clear of second practice pace-setter Russell.
||
Hamilton made it two Ferraris in the top four, from Verstappen, Alonso and the other Silver Arrows machine of Kimi Antonelli, with Piastri only able to place eighth – over Williams duo Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon – after making it back out on track.

Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto were 18th and 19th respectively for Sauber, with Yuki Tsunoda bringing up the rear after spending most of the session in the Red Bull garage while mechanics worked away on his car – the Japanese racer later being slapped with a 10-place grid penalty for the Grand Prix after a red flag infringement in the session.

||
Leclerc was one of a handful of drivers to pit at the end of the formation lap and swap intermediate tyres for slicks, but could not make much progress in the still slippery, cool conditions.
||
As the race progressed, with more rain forcing a switch back to intermediates, before conditions cleared up, Leclerc’s woes continued – the Monegasque ultimately crossing the line in 14th position after a late off through the high-speed Maggotts/Becketts complex.
||
Asked to sum up his afternoon, Leclerc sighed: “One of the most difficult races for me, if not the most difficult race of my career. I just struggled to keep the car on track from the first lap to the last lap.
||
“I don’t know from where it’s coming from. I’ll obviously look at the data. I kind of have an idea; it might be because of the set-up that I’m choosing at the moment, which is quite extreme.
||
“I really struggle to believe that set-up makes such a difference. I think there’s something that we’ve got to look at.”
||
Asked where he and Ferrari go from here, and how they reset before the next round in Belgium, Leclerc simply stated: “First by analysing and understanding what went on today. I struggled like crazy…”

Leclerc’s team mate, Lewis Hamilton, enjoyed a stronger race en route to fourth place, narrowly missing out on another home podium to the high-flying Kick Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg.

||
After hinting at good pace earlier in the weekend – having set the pace in the weekend’s opening practice session – Hamilton followed this up by going fastest during Q2, sparking celebratory scenes amongst his fans in the crowd.
||
The Briton went on to claim P2 during the first runs of Q3 but was not able to improve, leaving him in a final position of fifth.
||
Reflecting back on his final effort, Hamilton said: “The lap was pretty decent at the end and then I lost a bit of time in the last corner, which probably would have put me on the front row or at least third.
||
“We were right on the knife edge I think, other than that squeezed everything I could out the car.”
||
Pushed on whether he is taking the positives from being in the position to fight again as he continues to adapt to the SF-25, the 40-year-old responded: “I definitely feel a lot better in the car this weekend.
||
“This track is incredible, the crowd’s been amazing but we needed just a little bit more, like another tenth of performance in the car just to nudge us a little bit closer to the front guys.”
||
And while he is not starting as far up the order as he might have liked, Hamilton has not given up on dreaming of a podium at his home event.
||
“Of course, I’ll dream of it tonight and I’ll try and execute tomorrow,” he explained. “I think the weather’s going to be interesting, I’d imagine it’s dry probably for the race but it would be cool if it’s drizzling or… yeah, we’ll see.”
||
Team mate Charles Leclerc had also looked strong during the early stages of Qualifying but, like Hamilton, did not put his final lap together perfectly and wound up in P6.
||
Asked if he had been left frustrated by the session, the Monegasque conceded: “Yeah, horrible. Nothing really to say, I think the pace was there for the front row but I eventually didn’t do the job when I needed to. I lost the car in the last two corners and lost a lot of lap time.
||
“That’s been the story of the season, I need to find back my rhythm in Qualifying because I’m really struggling and I’m not putting everything together, and all the time I get out of the car there’s always one thing that hasn’t gone my way in Qualifying, so I’m very frustrated with myself more than anything.
||
“I know that in the race I’m doing a really good job generally, but I’ve got to put everything together.”
||
In terms of whether he still has a good race car for the main event – with Ferrari often faring better in race trim than Qualifying form – a downbeat Leclerc added: “As always yes, but when you are starting P6 then it’s going to be very difficult.”

When the session got under way at a slightly delayed time of 1135, drivers gradually trickled out on track to begin their programmes and assess the conditions – Pirelli’s soft, medium and hard compound tyres all being used in the opening minutes.

Lewis Hamilton was one of the early movers when the action got under way, bolting on a set of soft tyres and clocking a 1m 26.529s to hold the provisional P1 spot, which prompted plenty of cheers from the packed grandstand and grass banks around the track.

||
As per Friday’s running, there were some significant gusts of wind for Hamilton and the rest of the drivers to deal with – seemingly highlighted when Lance Stroll drifted his way out of the Luffield hairpin and just about prevented his Aston Martin from spinning.
||
Kimi Antonelli also reported a “massive moment” through the Maggotts and Becketts complex when he began to push, while there was drama for Alex Albon when he faced a slow-moving Aston Martin at the entry to Copse and swore over the radio to express his frustration.
||
As for lap times, Leclerc used the soft tyres to get down to a 1m 25.922s and take over from team mate Hamilton in P1, a couple of tenths clear of a more competitive looking Max Verstappen, who nonetheless complained of brake bias difficulties.
||
“A little bit of rain,” Leclerc then commented over the radio with around 20 minutes to go, but it was nowhere near enough to stop drivers from pumping in laps on slicks and making improvements – George Russell proving this when he slotted into second position.
||
With some 15 minutes remaining, Norris sent the home crowd wild again by going quickest on a 1m 25.606s, followed closely by Verstappen and team mate Piastri via similarly significant gains, before Leclerc fired in a 1m 25.498s to reclaim P1.
||
Hamilton was also on a rapid lap at this point, hitting the Sector 2 beam 0.074s clear of Leclerc, only for the red flag to be thrown for debris on track – meaning he had to abandon the effort. “We think the bodywork might be yours,” was the subsequent message to Haas driver Bearman.
||
The session resumed with a few minutes to go but was soon halted again when Gabriel Bortoleto lost control of his Kick Sauber through the aforementioned Maggotts/Becketts sweeps, bounced over the grass and ended in the gravel with suspension damage.
||
It meant Leclerc ended up fastest over Piastri, Verstappen and Norris, with Yuki Tsunoda an encouraging fifth for Red Bull, Bearman taking sixth despite another moment late on when he misjudged his entry to the pit lane, spun and damaged his front wing, and Albon putting Williams back into the top 10 positions.
||
Russell was the fastest of the Mercedes cars on a so far difficult weekend for the Silver Arrows, placing eighth over the Racing Bulls of Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson, Hamilton, and the other Williams and Haas machines of Carlos Sainz and Esteban Ocon.
||
Next up was Antonelli in 14th, as the Saubers of Nico Hulkenberg and Bortoleto along with the Aston Martins and Alpines brought up the rear – Fernando Alonso placing in front of Franco Colapinto, Stroll and Pierre Gasly.

""It's pretty incredible and also with McLaren and Red Bull having upgrades, so for us to be in the mix still given they have had a step today, it's really positive.
||
""I definitely feel like we can dream of having a strong weekend for sure. Executing and putting it all together and extracting it is another thing but I'll prepare myself the best I can to make sure we get the best result.""
||
Hamilton secured his equal-best Grand Prix result for Ferrari last time out in Austria after finishing fourth and believes he is getting to grips with the SF-25 having been off the pace compared with team mate, Charles Leclerc.
||
""I'm progressing a lot now with the car and much more comfortable knowing where it needs to be,"" he added.
||
""I think by FP2 we still weren't where we needed to be, so definitely struggled a little bit more, but we know the changes that we need to make for the next session.""
||
Leclerc also enjoyed a strong showing on Friday, finishing fourth in the first session and P2 during Free Practice 2.
||
While missing some one-lap pace compared to pacesetter Lando Norris and McLaren, Leclerc believes Ferrari's race pace will cause problems for the opposition on Sunday.
||
""The day was good,"" he said. We've been pretty strong so far so it's positive. I think we still need to find some pace in Qualifying.
||
""McLaren is once again probably the car to beat at the moment but in race pace I was happy. I'm finding my way, I'm changing quite a lot the car in weekends recently to try and find some pace in Qualifying.
||
""For now, I don't think I find a way for that, but in the race I'm really happy with where we are. I think we are very strong in the race but we've got to do a step forward in Qualifying.""

||
Ferrari brought floor upgrades to the SF-25 at the Red Bull Ring in a bid to get their season back on track following an up-and-down sequence of races that swung between fighting for trophies to struggling for minor points.
||
Having split McLaren pair Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in Qualifying, thanks in part to the Australian being hampered by yellow flags, Leclerc dropped to third at the first corner and held that ‘best of the rest’ spot thereafter, with team mate Lewis Hamilton backing him up in fourth.
||
Reflecting on Piastri’s first-lap pass, and how his race unfolded from that point, Leclerc said: “I was not planning to try and overtake in Turn 1, actually. I don’t think it’s very much possible here to try to go around Turn 1.
||
“As soon as I had a good start I was side-by-side and that was basically my position, then I had to brake early, Oscar overtook me around the outside, so there wasn’t much I could have done better there.
||
“But to be honest, if I would have kept second place, I’m pretty sure I would have got overtaken very quickly afterwards because they [the McLarens] were just too quick today.
||
“We still need to work hard. The team has done a great job in bringing those upgrades and we did steps in the right direction, but we are still missing a little bit of pace.”
||
Asked if he feels like there is now “light at the end of the tunnel” for Ferrari, Leclerc replied: “I hope so! I mean, we are working in the right direction for sure – this weekend proves it.
||
“I think we have done small steps in the right direction. We need to be careful to judge too quickly our upgrades. It does everything we wanted, but we need to wait maybe two or three races in order to judge it properly and to judge our actual pace properly.
||
“We are going in the right direction. I hope that we can bring new parts as soon as possible and if that’s the case then I hope that this will close the gap even more so with the McLaren.”
||
Hamilton was also keen to “take the positives” from the weekend – pointing to both Ferraris finishing within half a minute of winner Norris after some much bigger deficits so far this year.
||
“I think I’m slowly making progress, which is a real positive,” the seven-time World Champion said after the race. “We’ve made progress as a team, which is really positive.
||
“It’s great for us to be the second-fastest team this weekend and to be so close to… we’re not a minute down [on the leaders], which is really positive.
||
“Obviously we can’t do what the McLarens can do at the moment, but this is really I think down to the great upgrade that we had, and I think we had a better execution as a team this weekend.”
||
As for whether he and Ferrari can use the weekend as a stepping stone to more success, Hamilton continued: “I can see Qualifying is getting better. My race pace is not very good.
||
“I’m really struggling with the balance in the race. I had massive understeer in the low-speed and massive oversteer in the high-speed – nothing I could do with my tools could fix that.
||
“Also we have brake problems all the time, so I was struggling with the brakes, having to manage the brakes the whole race, which is never great and that was losing time – but we’ll take the positives this weekend!”
||
Ferrari have moved back up to second in the Teams’ Championship following Sunday’s race in Spielberg, one point ahead of rivals Mercedes, who failed to score with Kimi Antonelli after the rookie ran into Max Verstappen’s Red Bull on the opening lap.

||
While Norris proved to be in commanding form during Saturday’s session – setting the pace in Q1 and Q2 before continuing that to secure pole position in Q3 – Leclerc found himself as the Briton’s closest challenger, the Scuderia driver slotting into second ahead of Piastri in third.
||
It marks Leclerc’s first front row start since his home Grand Prix in May, and the 27-year-old was quick to praise his team after the session on a weekend in which they have delivered upgrades to the SF-25.
||
“I’m very pleased,” said Leclerc. “It’s been a long time since… I think it was Monaco the last time we started on the front row. It’s been a difficult season overall, but the team have kept pushing.
||
“We brought some new parts this weekend, which for sure made a difference, because if you look at the gaps everybody is super close, so it’s also thanks to the team. I’m very happy with the lap.
||
“It’s a good start to the weekend. We know that we have a better car normally in the race than we do in Qualifying, so I hope that we can put a bit more pressure on the McLarens tomorrow.”
||
Leclerc’s effort was 0.521s adrift of Norris’ impressive pole-setting time, marking the biggest pole margin of the season so far. When asked if he could imagine that lap, the eight-time race winner praised Norris as he responded: “Not with our car yet!
||
“We’re going to work towards that. But it’s not to minimise Lando’s job, obviously. He must have done an incredible lap. I haven’t seen it because I’ve just got out of the car, but I’ll definitely look at it. Congrats to him, he deserves it and tomorrow we’ll try and bring him a tough time.”
||
It was also a decent day for Leclerc’s team mate Lewis Hamilton, who took fourth to sit between Piastri and Mercedes’ George Russell. Reflecting on his day, the seven-time World Champion spoke positively about the steps forward that he is making in adapting to the car.
||
“I’m slowly progressing, little by little,” Hamilton commented. “Every time I go to a track I’m driving a new type of car on that track, and I’m always shocked and surprised by the characteristics being so different to what I raced with before.
||
“So you’re kind of rushing to learn as quickly as you can to catch up to someone that’s used to driving this car, it’s like the back of their hand.
||
“And then we got the upgrade this weekend which has been really positive, and the team did a fantastic job throughout Qualifying in terms of positioning and everything. It felt like operationally we were the best we’ve ever been, and so I’m really happy with that.”
||
Pushed on whether he could chase after a podium on race day at the Red Bull Ring, Hamilton answered: “I hope so. I was on for a front row, not pole but a second. But that’s a positive, I’ll take that and try and learn from that. I’ve been having some locking of the rears that I need to figure out.”
||
The grid slot marks Hamilton’s best in a Grand Prix since joining Ferrari, though the Briton claimed a pole position during Sprint Qualifying at Round 2 in China.

Charles Leclerc, meanwhile, sat out the session to hand his car over to rookie Dino Beganovic.","Lewis Hamilton has explained the issues he faced during a “not spectacular” Friday at the Austrian Grand Prix, with Ferrari team mate Charles Leclerc also suggesting that there is “a lot of work to be done” overnight.
||
While Leclerc sat out FP1 to hand his car over to rookie Dino Beganovic, Hamilton had a disrupted session owing to a gearbox problem, meaning that he lost time on track while the team worked on his SF-25 in the garage.
||
The seven-time World Champion eventually returned to action, but had the lowest lap count of the session. And while things ran more smoothly in FP2, the Briton – who ended the hour in 10th on the timesheets – admitted that it had not been a straightforward day at the Red Bull Ring.
||
Asked to assess his Friday, Hamilton responded: “Not spectacular. We had a problem in the morning with the gearbox, which was obviously difficult, frustrating for everyone in the garage obviously because the boys did a great job, kept topping it up.
||
“But you go out, you can only do one lap, and so we didn’t get the long runs. But I think we recovered okay with it, they did a great job changing the gearbox and getting us ready for FP2.
||
“Charles was six-tenths off, I was close to a second off, so not ideal. But I think there’s lots of learnings, so I think we will make some changes. Hopefully we can try and get a little bit closer. We won’t be at the front.”
||
Pushed on whether the new floor that the team have brought to the event is part of a wider package spread over the next few races aimed at moving the squad forwards, Hamilton said: “A huge amount of work went on to bring the floor, but as you see it’s not necessarily changed our competitiveness.
||
“The car actually doesn’t feel bad, we’re just a huge chunk off pace-wise, so we need to look into that and that’s about it really. We just keep pushing, just trying to dial the car in more and see what we can get, but it’s obviously very close in the top 10 so a tenth could make a difference, so we’ll work towards trying to gain at least that over the night.”
||
Leclerc also appeared disappointed by how Friday had unfolded, the Monegasque finishing his sole practice session in fifth place.
||
When quizzed on whether he was happy with his day’s work, Leclerc answered: “Not really. [Missing] FP1 didn’t really compromise FP2. I felt kind of at ease on the track straightaway, but not really at ease with the car and the way the car feels, so there’s quite a bit of work to be done for tomorrow.
||
“It doesn’t feel like the performance is quite there yet, but hopefully we will put everything together tomorrow and do a step forward, but there’s quite a lot of work to be done tonight.
||
“Long run [pace] seems to be more positive as we very often have – we are faster on the race [pace] than we are in Qualifying. In Qualifying there’s a lot of work to be done.”
||
Despite the difficulties on Friday, Leclerc remains confident that Ferrari’s race pace can at least put them nearer to their rivals in theory.
||
“Our race pace is very positive,” the eight-time race winner commented. “We were, I would say, [setting] very similar lap times to the fastest guys, so that’s good, but the problem is that we’ve seen recently that everything is so close, and as soon as you start P6, P7, then in the race it’s extremely difficult to come back where you should be.
||
“So that’s really our target, is to try and maximise Qualifying – whether we’ll make it or not I don’t know, but there will be a lot of work tonight to try and maximise that.”
||
As for Beganovic, the F2 driver was delighted to experience FP1 at the wheel of the SF-25, the 21-year-old admitting that he felt “on it straightaway”.
||
“It felt very good, it’s always very nice to drive an F1 car,” said Beganovic. “Doing an F1 weekend is obviously even more special, and on top of that doing it in a Ferrari, even more special. It means a lot to me.
||
“This is my sixth year now [in the Ferrari Driver Academy], so it’s been a long journey and here we are doing the steps towards my goal, which is to have an F1 seat one day, and doing these programmes that we have in the Academy really helps me to show myself but also get a first taste of what it is.”

||
The seven-time World Champion joined the Scuderia at the start of the 2025 campaign, creating a collaboration that has been highly scrutinised due to the success both Hamilton and Ferrari have enjoyed in the past.
||
But the 40-year-old Briton has struggled during the opening half of the season, failing to reach the podium in the 10 Grands Prix so far and generally lacking pace compared with team mate, Charles Leclerc.
||
Despite taking pole and the victory in the China Sprint, Hamilton has had to field questions about his lack of performance in Ferrari's SF-25, and ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix this weekend, he stated that he was looking at the bigger picture.
||
Hamilton said: ""Would we prefer it if we were straight away just winning races? I'm sure people in the garage wish we were straight away winning but I think, for me, I'm grateful we're going through this process.
||
""We're doing a lot of building, there are a lot of changes that need to be made that we're working towards.
||
""I'm focused more on changes in the background, foundation building stuff that we need to put in place in order to have a better 2026.""
||
Hamilton also confirmed that Ferrari has brought a floor upgrade for the event this weekend, but that it was difficult to say how much difference it would make to bring Ferrari closer to the leading teams.
||
""You always want upgrades so I'm grateful for every little bit, whether it's small or a big piece,"" Hamilton added. ""What I would say is don't expect much change.
||
""Hopefully tomorrow we'll find something that we didn't expect but again, we don't really know. Hopefully it will be a step forward in the right direction and I think that's the most important thing, that we are moving forwards.""
||
Ferrari currently find themselves third in the Constructors' Championship, just 16 points behind Mercedes, thanks in part to three podiums for Leclerc this season.
||
The Monegasque driver will miss FP1 as his seat during the opening practice session on Friday will be taken by Ferrari Academy Driver, Dino Beganovic.
||
""We've got upgrades coming this weekend so it's a bit more of a positive feeling, hoping that this will close the gap to the guys in front,"" said Leclerc.
||
""Apart from that we're just fully focused on how we can maximise this weekend. That's always the goal.
||
""I'll be missing FP1 so that will also be important to recover those lack of laps in FP2 and FP3 but I'm not too concerned about this. It's a track that I enjoy and hope that we can start to turn the situation around a little bit and challenge a bit more in front.""

||
Charles Leclerc came home fifth and Lewis Hamilton sixth, both inheriting a position thanks to the late retirement of Lando Norris. But Ferrari were not on the pace of Mercedes, Red Bull or McLaren – and that wasn’t purely down to the car.
||
Leclerc crashed on Friday in Free Practice 1, which cost him the entirety of FP2 as well.
||
There were also question marks over the tyre strategy in Qualifying, with Ferrari focusing on using the C6 soft while Mercedes and Red Bull used the medium to good effect. Those questions intensified during the race, with Leclerc querying the decision to put him onto a two-stop strategy.
||
And Ferrari's cause was not helped by Hamilton picking up floor damage after hitting an animal.
||
“I think we made too many mistakes collectively from the beginning with the crash in FP1, with the mistake in Quali, with the marmot in the race,” Vasseur explained.
||
""And at the end the fight is so tight – I'm not speaking about lap time or race time, I'm speaking about that you can change the position for almost nothing from one weekend to another one.
||
“It's a good lesson also from Mercedes. They were nowhere the last three weekends and they were able to have the two cars on the podium this weekend.
||
“I'm not sure that they changed completely the car, it's more that from the beginning of the weekend, from Lap 1 on Friday morning, they were there, they did a good job in the preparation and so on. And honestly this weekend, for different reasons, the focus was not always there [for us].”
||
Vasseur added that, with the margins so small in 2025, executing the perfect weekend matters almost more than car set-up or any upgrades a team might bring.
||
“Honestly, I'm not sure that the characteristic of the car is the main issue today. The main issue is to do a good usage of the tyres first, and to understand the tyres and to choose the good ones for the Quali, and the exercise is quite difficult.
||
“I think today that Max [Verstappen] and Mercedes did a better job on the weekend than McLaren and us, but they were also into the choice of the tyres probably from the beginning of the weekend, and this you have to commit from Friday morning almost.
||
“Even before the weekend, you have to put everything together in the right place if you want to achieve a good result today, because in the tyre usage and the tyre performance, or what performance you get from the tyres, I think there is much more than between the cars.
||
“It doesn't matter the car, if the team is doing a very good job on the tyres, they will be in front. It's true this weekend, it was true in Monaco, it was true in Imola, and it is like it is, and it will be like this until the end of the season. But it's the same for everybody, we have to do a better job.”
||
Vasseur hinted that Ferrari would have some small upgrades in Austria – but was keen to stress that sharpening up the operation across the whole weekend would have far bigger an impact than any upgrades.
||
“If we want to achieve, if we want to start from the first rows and to have a clean weekend as [in] Monaco, we need to do a very smooth weekend in terms of execution, and it's where we failed massively in Canada,” he concluded.
||
Ferrari have slipped back to third in the Teams’ Championship, 16 points behind Mercedes.

||
The Monegasque’s weekend got off to a frustrating start with a big crash in the first practice session, which damaged his chassis and prevented him from partaking in FP2, subsequently putting him on the back foot for the critical Qualifying hour.
||
While Ferrari were able to fully repair his car, a mistake in Q3 angered him further as he was forced to settle for eighth position on the grid, with his team mate Lewis Hamilton ahead in P5.
||
Starting on hard tyres while most of the top 10 were on mediums, Leclerc progressed through the race and led it at times when the other frontrunners pitted, but ultimately finished in fifth place at the chequered flag.
||
“Honestly, I think today is kind of the result of my mistakes,” he later summarised. “FP1, Qualifying, the traffic… all in all I think that puts us a little bit in a difficult situation because we start further back on the grid.
||
“Then for strategy, there’s been a bit of talk on the radio. I was of the opinion that the one-stop could work, the team was more of the opinion that the two-stop was the right way. Eventually, the team is making the final call because they have more information than I do.
||
“I wanted to make it clear that this was not what I was thinking, but I understand. I will speak with the team and I’ll explain to them what I saw that made me think that this was the wrong choice. Overall, I don’t think that this has completely changed our race result. Eventually that’s where we deserved to finish.
||
“The pace was pretty strong. I think the starting position was just very difficult to deal with because then you’ve got to overtake and it makes everything difficult. I don’t think FP1 hurt our weekend that much.”
||
It was also a tricky weekend for Hamilton, who ended the race a position behind Leclerc in P6. Halfway through, a radio message from his engineer explained that the team thought his pace was good considering damage he had suffered, which was later revealed to be the consequence of the Briton hitting a groundhog on track.
||
Asked to talk about the damage, he said: “It was bad. The whole front of the floor was basically destroyed on the right side. To still get sixth with that damage, I’m really grateful so I’ll definitely take it.
||
“We almost had brake failure as well – the pedal went super long so I had to manage these brakes for a period of time, and then they came back towards the end. Given those issues, I’m grateful for the points.
||
“We have problems with our brakes quite often. Honestly, I’ve never had these brake issues until this year. I guess they just got hot or something like that. The pedal went super long and I was hitting the brake and it wasn’t stopping, then I had to do a bunch of lift and coast to cool it down.”

“Our pace was there,” Leclerc reflected after Qualifying. “I think the car was good enough for pole, but I f***** it up completely and I’m very annoyed. I just got out the car so obviously emotions are running high. I’m very annoyed.
||
“I don’t know if it was the right thing or not to go out early – we ended up having Isack [Hadjar] in the middle of Turn 6 or 7. He was 100 metres in front, but with these cars and on a track like this you lose all the grip.

When pushed on whether this recovery gave him hope for what he could achieve on Sunday, Leclerc responded: “No, it’s irrelevant. When you do that in Qualifying then there’s nothing that gives me satisfaction.”

On the other side of the garage, Hamilton did not have an entirely smooth session but was keen to take the positives as he prepares to line up in P5 on a day where former Mercedes team mate George Russell grabbed pole position.

“We were never going to get pole, I think, clearly,” the seven-time World Champion reflected. “Mercedes brought an upgrade I think, or I just heard, and congrats to them. Their car’s always suited this track, so [I’m] happy for them.

“On our side it’s been very, very, very tricky, but I think a better performance than Ferrari had last year which is positive, and I’m still going to be gunning for trying to see if we can get a podium for once – that’s the goal tomorrow.”

||
With Ferrari forced to change the survival cell on Leclerc’s SF-25 as a result of the damage sustained, the Monegasque was not able to take part in the subsequent FP2 session, meaning he ended the day on just nine laps.
||
Asked for his reflections on the incident, Leclerc said: “First of all, I feel sorry for the whole team, because obviously that’s never something you want.
||
“It was a very stupid crash – I had a lock-up, I thought I would make the corner… I knew I would go in the grass, but I thought that was enough to not touch the wall. Unfortunately, when I then ended up in the grass, I understood that there was no room anymore.
||
“It’s just a misjudgment, but a misjudgment that cost a lot. The way the wheel has touched the chassis basically cracked the chassis, and we cannot use two chassis on the same day, so that meant basically the whole day not in the car.

||
“That hurts because that obviously cost us quite a few laps today, but the very positive thing is that I felt very confident with the car. I think we were very competitive at that time, for whatever it’s worth, because it was only the third [push] lap of the day.”
||
While he will only have an hour of practice to prepare for Saturday’s Qualifying session in FP3, Leclerc is hopeful of bouncing back and putting up a fight in the grid decider.
||
“It doesn’t hurt my confidence, and I’m sure that it won’t hurt my weekend at all,” he commented. “I’m sure I’ll be up to speed in Qualifying. How competitive we will be is another matter, and then we’ll have to see. But I’m sure that personally I’ll be 100%.”
||
Lewis Hamilton, meanwhile, placed fifth in FP1 and eighth in FP2, with the seven-time World Champion admitting his day started better than it finished.
||
“Not great, not particularly great,” he summed up. “I love driving here and the crowd’s been amazing today, but the car is a lot different to what I’ve experienced here in the past.

||
“I think P1 was alright, then we made some changes. Honestly, I thought the car was quicker, and we just went slower, or they [our rivals] went quicker.”
||
Hamilton added that there will be “some changes to make” before FP3, having reported rear locking through FP2, while previewing the challenge ahead for Qualifying.
||
“I don’t know [what’s possible],” he said. “I think it will be a challenge to get into Q3 at this rate, but not impossible. Then I think trying to fight to get into the top five is going to be tough.”

||
After showing flashes of strong pace during the weekend, Hamilton lined up in P5 on the grid for his home race and suggested that he would not give up hope of a podium.
||
That dream very nearly came true as the 40-year-old found himself in fourth and chasing down third-placed Nico Hulkenberg in the latter stages of the Grand Prix, before ultimately missing out on the rostrum by just over five seconds.
||
Sharing his reflections after jumping out of the car, Hamilton said: “[It was a] difficult race, not a great one from my side. I did the best I could.
||
“As it showed there was plenty of mistakes out there and very, very tricky conditions, in really a very, very hard car to drive here – this car doesn’t like those conditions. Not ideal, but we got some points at least.”
||
Hamilton’s pace appeared to drop off slightly as he embarked on a second stint on the intermediate tyres before switching to the soft compound in the final phase.
||
Asked to summarise that segment of the race, he explained: “The tyres [were] dropping off, the car doesn’t like low-speed corners, lots of understeer, and I started knocking out the left front and then just couldn’t keep up.”
||
Despite the disappointment of missing out on a top-three result, Hamilton could still take the positives from racing in front of his home crowd.
||
“What I take from it is the amazing energy from all the fans,” the Briton said.
||
“They’ve been incredible this weekend and it’s been amazing to see so many people switch to red and, yeah, got some points.”

While you may not agree with the order, we hope you enjoy the stories of these epic races that have helped make this sport what it is today. You can read the introduction to the series and see the list of races here.
||
At No. 18, Anna Francis recalls the 2007 European Grand Prix at the Nurburgring, an event that featured everything from a backmarker leading on their debut, a dramatic Turn 1 pile-up courtesy of treacherous rain and a thrilling late-race duel that sparked quite the fallout after the chequered flag.
||
As this countdown of F1’s greatest races highlights, a Grand Prix can become a classic for a variety of reasons; perhaps there was a storyline-packed build-up that heightened the tension, or the weather proved unpredictable and an unexpected turn of events unfolded, or maybe the drama continued well after the chequered flag had fallen.
||
The 2007 European Grand Prix basically ticked off every point on this list. It was an encounter that took place in the middle of a fascinating and closely-fought season, with the Nurburgring playing host to the 10th round of a 17-race calendar – and a race that lives on in the memories of fans 18 years later.
||
Lewis Hamilton, in his rookie campaign for McLaren, arrived into the weekend as the championship leader – and, given the points system then in play (which awarded the top eight drivers, from 10 points for the winner through to one for P8), he would leave still on top regardless of the result, having built a 12-point advantage over team mate Fernando Alonso.
||
However, evidently Alonso – who was equal on wins with Hamilton, the pair having taken two apiece – could still cut into Hamilton’s lead if the cards fell in his favour. Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen also remained in the mix, sitting third in the standings just six points adrift of Alonso after claiming three victories, while the other red car of Felipe Massa had won twice.
||
It was Hamilton and Raikkonen who set the pace during the weekend’s practice sessions, but the former’s strong run hit a snag when he suffered a heavy crash in Q3 of Qualifying, the right front tyre on his MP4-22 bursting and sending him into the wall at Turn 8. Team boss Ron Dennis blamed the incident on a faulty wheel gun failing to secure the tyre to the car.
||
Hamilton was airlifted to hospital for precautionary checks – after reassuringly giving a thumbs-up to the crowd – and his participation in Sunday’s race remained in doubt. Having been unable to continue in the session, the Briton’s original time put him in 10th, while Raikkonen took pole ahead of Alonso and Massa.
||
After the dust settled on that eventful Saturday, attentions switched to Sunday’s race. Hamilton returned to action and joined the rest of the pack as they lined up for the 60-lap encounter in initially dry conditions – but the weather forecast looked ominous…
||
While the dark clouds that had gathered over the Nurburgring hinted at imminent rain, the field lined up on slick tyres. Further back, however, Spyker’s Markus Winkelhock – making his F1 debut – pitted for wet tyres at the end of the formation lap, meaning that he would start the race from the pit lane.
||
Within just a couple of laps, that would prove to be something of a genius call by the backmarker team. Raikkonen had initially led from pole, with Massa following after getting ahead of Alonso, while Hamilton made an impressive start to climb up to sixth by the first corner.
||
However, a collision between the BMW Sauber cars resulted in Hamilton getting tagged and picking up a puncture, dropping the McLaren backwards. Meanwhile rain had started to fall on some parts of the circuit – prompting the majority of the field to pit at the end of Lap 1 for intermediate tyres.
||
Raikkonen was one of the few to remain out on track, having missed the pit entry after a mistake in the increasingly tricky conditions. While the Finn made a stop after Lap 2 along with the other cars that had stayed out, Winkelhock had found himself in the lead.
||
But soon the rain had become even heavier, sparking incredible scenes as car after car aquaplaned off the circuit and into the gravel at Turn 1, where something of a ‘river’ of standing water had formed.
||
The Safety Car was deployed as the process of recovering a total of five stricken cars began, but it was quickly decided that conditions were too dangerous to continue in, meaning that the race was red flagged.
||
After around 15 minutes, the drivers prepared to take the restart – with the exception of Jenson Button (Honda), Adrian Sutil (Spyker), Nico Rosberg (Williams), Scott Speed (Toro Rosso) and Vitantonio Liuzzi (Toro Rosso), all of whom had fallen victim to the Turn 1 car park.
||
Hamilton, meanwhile, had been amongst those to aquaplane off the circuit but, having kept his engine running, his McLaren was hoisted back onto the track by a crane, meaning that he was able to continue on in the race under the regulations then in place.
||
While the Briton was a lap down at the restart, he was able to unlap himself as the Grand Prix resumed under the Safety Car, before diving into the pits to bolt on slick tyres. It was a gamble that failed to pay off as he soon had another foray off the still-wet track, though again managed to rejoin.
||
Winkelhock’s moment in the sun also quickly came to an end after a few laps, with the likes of Massa and Alonso soon overtaking him – and things worsened further when his Spyker suffered a hydraulic failure on Lap 15, bringing his eventful sole F1 appearance to an early end.
||
It soon transpired that Winkelhock would not be the only retiree following the restart, with Ralf Schumacher (Toyota) and Takuma Sato (Super Aguri) each recording a DNF a few laps later – but a ninth and final retirement would prove to be the most significant in terms of the championship fight….
||
While his switch to slick tyres had initially backfired, Hamilton subsequently looked to have strong pace on a track that was drying out, leading other frontrunners to pit for dry tyres. One of the first to do so was Raikkonen, allowing the Finn to haul himself back up to third behind Massa and Alonso.
||
The Ferrari driver continued to chase down the leaders from there – yet his charge was brought to an abrupt halt when his car was struck by a mechanical issue, forcing him to retire at just over half distance in a blow to his title hopes.
||
It still seemed as if the Scuderia were on for victory at the Nurburgring, though, thanks to the sister car of Massa, who maintained his lead over Alonso through what had looked to be the final round of pit stops, despite the two-time World Champion slowly closing in.
||
But the weather gods had not quite finished their day’s work yet. The rain returned as the race entered into its final 10 laps, leading to another flurry of action in the pit lane as the majority of the field headed in for intermediate tyres – with the exception of Hamilton, taking another gamble by remaining out on the slicks.
||
However, with the downpour showing no signs of abating, Hamilton eventually had to stop, dropping him down to 10th place. Meanwhile, the other McLaren of Alonso was trying to find a way past Massa.
||
On Lap 56 the move finally came, with Alonso boldly going around the outside at Turn 5 in a sequence that saw the two cars make contact. Further back, team mate Hamilton also gained a position before the end by grabbing P9 from Renault’s Giancarlo Fisichella.
||
As the chequered flag fell on an action-packed afternoon at the Nurburging, Alonso crossed the line to take victory by eight seconds from Massa, while Red Bull’s Mark Webber completed the podium in third. The race might have been over, but there was still more drama to come…
||
After the drivers had arrived into parc ferme, Alonso highlighted the damage that he had picked up in his scrap with Massa, directing the television cameras to zoom in on the area of his car affected as he wagged his finger.
||
The fallout did not end there either; any fans watching that day will doubtless recall the heated debate that ensued between Massa and Alonso before heading out onto the podium, with Massa eventually walking away from the two-time World Champion – who seemed to brush off the argument by smiling at the watching camera and victoriously pumping his fist in the air.
||
They then proceeded to the rostrum for a slightly tense podium ceremony, with a marked contrast between the jubilant Alonso and a still perturbed Massa – and as if that didn’t make it memorable enough, Michael Schumacher formed part of the ceremony following his retirement just a few months earlier, the seven-time World Champion tasked with handing the Teams’ trophy to former rival Ron Dennis.
||
Massa later said about his clash with Alonso in the post-race press conference: “I was really surprised when he came to say that I did that on purpose. I would never do something like that on purpose.”
||
Alonso, meanwhile, suggested he was sorry for the argument as he added: “We touched each other two times [on the track] and I apologise to him because I was so stressed when I finished the race, because we nearly didn't finish the race.
||
“I apologise if I said anything to him, because it's motor racing and it's a fight. We finished the race, so I don't want to talk any more about this and I want to enjoy the win.”
||
With Alonso having closed the gap to just two points to Hamilton in the championship standings, it marked the latest twist in a dramatic season famed for what would become an increasingly tense intra-team battle between the McLaren pair.
||
Indeed, just one race later in Hungary, a notorious incident took place where Alonso remained stationary in the squad’s pit box during Qualifying with Hamilton waiting behind, resulting in Hamilton then not having enough time to complete a lap.
||
Alonso only won one more race that season after his Nurburgring triumph, while Hamilton claimed a further two victories – but it was Raikkonen’s late-season momentum that helped ‘the Iceman’ to make a remarkable comeback and win his one and only championship by just one point, the last time to date that a driver claimed a title for Ferrari.

||
With the film out now following it's international release on June 25, and a North American launch on June 27, the public can now view the final product after years of hard work on and off track.
||
Set in the thrilling world of Formula 1 – with Pitt playing Sonny Hayes, a former F1 driver who makes his comeback at the fictional APXGP team – here are the key cast members that star in the blockbuster film and the characters they portray.
||
From Fight Club to F1, Brad Pitt has been one of Hollywood’s leading men for almost four decades.
||
F1 The Movie isn’t Pitt's first rodeo in sports films either; in 2011, he produced and starred in the Oscar-nominated drama Moneyball, which saw immense success and critical acclaim.
||
Pitt has had his fair share of playing the underdog, as he now dons the veil of Sonny Hayes, a retired F1 driver given the chance to make a comeback.
||
Decades after a devastating crash ruined his dreams of becoming an F1 World Champion, F1 The Movie showcases Hayes' journey back in the sport alongside his rookie team mate Joshua Pearce at APXGP.
||
British actor Damson Idris made his way to Hollywood from the success of his recurring role in the crime drama Snowfall.
||
Idris has worked on a range of projects from theatre to indie films, and has proved his talents belong with the likes of seasoned stars such as Brad Pitt.
||
In F1 The Movie he portrays Joshua Pearce, a rookie F1 driver who partners with Pitt’s Sonny Hayes in the struggling APXGP team.
||
The film showcases the relationship between the two eager drivers as their team looks to fight for victories throughout the season.
||
Former Marvel voice actress Kerry Condon is set to play the role of the APXGP Technical Director, who strikes up a romance with Pitt’s Sonny Hayes.
||
The Irish actress began her career in theatre, earning awards for her Shakespearean performances before jumping into Irish indie films.
||
With an Oscar nomination and a BAFTA win for her role in The Banshees of Inisherin, Condon's range shows that the role of Kate is in great hands.
||
With an Oscar, BAFTA, SAG Award, and a Golden Globe on his mantlepiece, Javier Bardem is one of those actors who is used to critical acclaim.
||
He began his career 30 years ago in the Spanish film industry, before going on to work with directors like Woody Allen and featuring in blockbusters like the James Bond film Skyfall.
||
Bardem plays a crucial role in F1 The Movie, bringing Pitt’s Sonny Hayes back to the forefront of F1 through his role as the APXGP team owner.
||
Ruben Cervantes is Hayes’ friend and former team mate, who employs two fresh faces to rescue his struggling F1 team.
||
Danish actor Kim Bodnia joins the crew as Kaspar Molinski, the APXGP Team Principal, who once worked for Ferrari.
||
Bodnia has picked up several television awards for his performances in The Bridge and other Danish shows, as well as a BAFTA for his role in Killing Eve.
||
The F1 Movie will be his first role in a blockbuster film, with Molinski pushing Sonny Hayes to the limit.
||
The Crown actor Tobias Menzies is set to play Peter Banning, an APXGP board member, who is intent on pushing Javier Bardem’s character, Ruben Cervantes, to sell the struggling team.
||
Menzies is an accomplished British television actor who has picked up an Emmy, as well as Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for roles in Outlander, Rome, and Game of Thrones.
||
Menzies joined the F1 project after completing his award-winning run as Lucas in the play The Hunt, returning to film after a two-year break.
||
British actress Sarah Niles stars in F1 The Movie as Bernadette, the mother of rookie Joshua Pearce (played by Damson Idris).
||
Niles has a long list of credits to her name across television and film, having appeared in series including Catastrophe, Riches and the acclaimed I May Destroy You.
||
But the actress is perhaps best known for her role as Dr Sharon Fieldstone in the hit sports comedy-drama Ted Lasso, for which she has previously been nominated for an Emmy award.
||
APXGP’s Chief Mechanic, Dodge, is played by Abdul Salis, a key member of the squad’s line-up as the team pair up with the returning Sonny Hayes.
||
The British actor has appeared in a range of TV shows, including long-running roles in the British television drama Casualty and more recently in American fantasy series The Wheel of Time.
||
Salis has also starred on the big screen previously in movies such as Love Actually and Sahara.
||
Callie Cooke joins the cast as Jodie, an APXGP pit crew mechanic.
||
Away from the screen, Cooke was nominated for the Emerging Talent Award at the Evening Standard Theatre Awards in 2015.
||
Since then the British actress has also garnered several television credits, having appeared in the likes of Doctor Who and Cheaters.
||
Before Sonny Hayes makes his comeback to Formula 1, the racer is competing in the Daytona 24 Hours for Chip Hart, played by Shea Whigham.
||
F1 The Movie follows on from some other high-octane big screen appearances for Whigham, the American actor having previously starred in films from the Mission Impossible and Fast & Furious franchises.
||
As well as featuring in Oscar-nominated movies such as The Wolf of Wall Street and Joker, Whigham holds various television credits, most notably in the American drama series Boardwalk Empire.
||
In the role of Sonny Hayes’ race engineer, Nickleby, is British actor Will Merrick.
||
After appearing on the stage in theatre productions, Merrick made his television debut in the British drama series Skins in 2011, a role that earned him a Royal Television Society award for Best Actor.
||
He has since starred in various other TV shows as well as featuring in films such as About Time and Barbie.
||
Joseph Kosinski made a stellar directorial debut with Disney’s Tron Legacy and has since fine-tuned a very specific and successful filmmaking style.
||
What shot him to the top of the ranks was the hugely popular Top Gun: Maverick, which redefined blockbusters and gave him the chance to create a truly unique F1 movie.
||
Kosinski brought together his award-winning Top Gun: Maverick team and, with the script written by Ehren Kruger, made F1 a reality.
||
The American film and television producer has an endless list of hits in his portfolio; from Pirates of the Caribbean to Bad Boys, Jerry Bruckheimer knows what film-goers want.
||
Bruckheimer began his endeavour into big-budget films in the 1990s with Paramount, working with directors like Michael Bay on some of the biggest box office hits of the decade.
||
He then branched out into television, before becoming an independent producer in the 2010s, and he was also one of the main factors in the success of Top Gun: Maverick, catapulting the film to stardom, which was an ethos he followed through to F1.
||
The seven-time Formula 1 World Champion knows a thing or two about the sport and took on a producing role on the F1 movie to help ensure the authenticity of the production.
||
Hamilton’s role on the film places him in the realm of a consultant, helping actors Brad Pitt and Damson Idris hone their driving skills as well as scriptwriters fine-tune dialogue.
||
With a Formula 1 driver on board, Hamilton also helped give the movie a level of detail that has garnered praise from everyone who worked with him.

||
Speaking during Thursday’s media day in Montreal, Hamilton was quizzed on reports about Vasseur’s position at the team, leading the seven-time World Champion to reiterate that, while things may not always be completely smooth for the squad behind the scenes, he fully supports Vasseur.
||
“It’s definitely not nice to hear that there’s stories like that out there,” Hamilton responded. “Firstly I love working with Fred – Fred’s the main reason I’m in this team and got the opportunity to be here, for which I’m forever grateful for, and we’re in this together.
||
“We’re working hard in the background, things aren’t perfect but, for me, I’m here to work with the team but also with Fred – I want Fred here. I do believe Fred is the person to take us to the top, so that’s that. So it’s all nonsense.
||
“Most people don’t know what’s going on in the background. It isn’t all easy, it’s not like it’s all the smoothest sailing in the background – we are having to make changes and there is a lot of work to do, and there is naturally a lot of pressure because we want to win, but that’s not any part of the discussion at moment.”

Pushed further on whether he feels it would be a mistake for Ferrari to make changes at the top, Hamilton added: “I don’t think that’s on the cards as far as I’m aware and that’s certainly not something I would be supportive of.
||
“Embedding new people, new personnel, whether it’s a driver or engineer or people who run an organisation, it takes time to adjust and the impact that has is significant, so that’s not part of the discussion. I’m here to win with Fred and he has my full support.”
||
Hamilton also stressed his own focus on continuing to build his future with the Italian team as he continued: “I’ve literally just started here with Ferrari and I’m here for several years, and I’m here for the long-haul, so there is no question in where my head’s at and what I’m working towards achieving with this team, so there’s zero doubts.”
||
For now the Briton is looking ahead to the weekend at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, one in which he will be hoping for a smoother outing after a tough race last time out in Spain.
||
However, Hamilton admitted that it came as something of a relief to learn that an issue had been discovered on both his and Leclerc’s cars later on, offering an explanation for the challenges he faced.

Pushed on how much the problem had been affecting him during the Grand Prix, the 40-year-old answered: “Massively. Unfortunately the team don’t want us to talk too much about it, but we both had issues that were hindering us massively from halfway through race already.
||
“What I didn’t know is whether or not we had that problem, but obviously I said on the radio that it was the worst feeling in the car I’ve ever had, and it truly was with that issue. At the end of the race, I was kind of like, ‘Jeez, I’ve never experienced something this bad for such a prolonged time through a race’.

“It wasn’t until after the TV interviews I got back to the engineers and we found out there was an issue, so it was a bit of a relief to hear that because it definitely didn’t feel so terrible afterwards.”

“So it’s just all noise, and we don't really pay any attention to it. So it can continue if you want, but it doesn't make any difference to the job that we're trying to do.”

In reference to that message in Monte Carlo, Hamilton added: “It was literally just there [were] areas that were… we just had radio problems through the race, [and I] didn't get all the information that I wanted.”

After acting as a producer on the motion picture, the seven-time World Champion has been opening up on the “incredible learning process” involved, his experiences of working with Brad Pitt, and why he believes it will be the “most authentic racing movie that’s ever been made”…

||
Tell me about stepping into your role as a producer on F1 The Movie and what it means to bring Formula 1 racing to the big screen in a way that’s never been seen before?
||
Coming on board to this project as a producer has been such an incredible learning process for me, seeing what goes into making a feature film, and there’s been a lot of learning on the other side too as everyone has got to grips with Formula 1.
||
I’ve always loved film and telling stories, and I’ve loved this sport since I was five years old, so when I got the opportunity to speak with Joe Kosinski and Jerry Bruckheimer about the project, it felt like the two worlds I’m passionate about coming together.
||
I remember in the early days of the project I got to meet with Brad and go through the script, join meetings with the teams at Apple and Formula 1, and be part of some of the early casting processes. From those first conversations, to watching it all come together, it’s just been a super cool experience and I can’t wait for everyone to see it!

||
Why will this be the most authentic racing film of all time?
||
The access we’ve had to Formula 1 is totally unheard of, we actually filmed on race weekends with the film’s 11th team – APXGP, and you’ll definitely see that authenticity come through in the film.
||
The footage filmed throughout the racing calendar will be blended into the movie and augmented with digital techniques to insert the movie’s team cars in the actual race footage, so it will seem really realistic for fans of the sport.
||
But they’ve really welcomed my insights into the smaller details too, like the sounds a car would make when it’s at a certain position on the track, or the way a crash might happen. It’s what Joe [Kosinski, director] and Jerry [Bruckheimer, producer] wanted from the start, to make the most authentic racing movie that’s ever been made.
||
You mention filmmakers Joe Kosinski and Jerry Bruckheimer, who together reached new cinematic heights with Top Gun: Maverick. How will F1 The Movie build on that track record?
||
I grew up seeing Jerry’s name come up on screens at the cinema and he’s such a legend, so to finally be in a room and working with him was such an honor.
||
He’s still so enthusiastic, even with all the accolades and all the success he’s had, he’s just so passionate about what he does and that’s been so inspiring to see. And I was really, really impressed by Joe and how he works, his laser focus, his ideas, his eye for how to capture things.

||
As a producer on the film, what innovations did you witness that would make this film unlike any other racing film in history?
||
Developing technology. Camera placement. Some of what they used with the fighter jets on Top Gun: Maverick, Joe brought part of that technology to this, and his team and our cinematographer Claudio Miranda, working with Apple, took it to another level.
||
They developed this camera system and it’s so different, so much more advanced than what you’re watching when you watch a race during the weekend. The footage is much more raw, so when you’re watching the film you really feel like you’re in the car and going at super high speeds.
||
Tell me about working with Brad Pitt – he’s a fellow producer as well as starring in the movie.
||
I never thought I would get to work with Brad Pitt. I’m a huge fan of his films, and I think the first time I met him was in Jerry’s office over Zoom, which was crazy enough, but then we got to go to a track and I learned how much he’s into motorsport, particularly bikes, and saw the natural ability he had behind the wheel. It was really cool.
||
BEHIND THE SCENES: How the upcoming ‘F1’ movie plays into the sport’s great underdog tradition
||
I remember us both standing at Silverstone circuit, at Copse, and I was showing him the things that I look for when I’m going into that corner, and we were talking about the fact that ultimately drivers are elite athletes and there is so much that goes into racing that you don’t see; the G-force and everything that our bodies go through, the rigorous training we have to do to be able to do these races.
||
He was really interested in that level of insight so he could bring as much authenticity as possible to his role.
||
How does Brad embody the role of this veteran driver, Sonny Hayes?
||
I think he’s done an amazing job. He really brings a huge amount to the character of Sonny as a driver, but also to how his character nurtures an up-and-coming underdog.
||
For racing drivers, it’s important to work as a team but ultimately every other driver on track is your competition – even your team mate. So, there’s a real fine line and I think you get to see that play out between these two characters played by Brad and Damson [Idris].
||
READ MORE: ‘It’s very, very special’ – Drivers share their reactions after getting exclusive first look at the upcoming ‘F1’ film
||
Part of the authenticity in the film is that you have Brad and Damson really driving these cars at real races. Why was that important to you as a filmmaker?
||
I think having Brad and Damson drive was integral to the authenticity of the story because, through my career, I would tell people how difficult it is in the race, and they’re like, “How much weight did you lose” or “What bruises do you have after a race?” or “What? You don’t have AC in the car?”
||
It’s super demanding. And yeah, we can lose up to 10 pounds within the race.  So, I think having these two actors go through the process of the mental challenges that we go through as racing drivers – the speed in which you’re processing information, the affect on the body, how strong the brakes are, the G-forces…
||
I think it was really important for them because you can’t fake that. If you’ve not experienced it, you can’t imagine. By driving these cars – and they both did a great job – I think both of them got a real appreciation for what being a racing driver really means, and that’s what you get to see in the film.

||
What’s it mean to you to know audiences are finally going to see this movie you produced on the big screen – the biggest screen?
||
Going from a treatment to seeing a whole script, working through a script, then going through developing cameras, through that whole process to now seeing it on a big screen… it’s amazing. I can’t wait to see people’s reactions, and how it makes them feel.
||
There’s so much authenticity and you really feel the speed and the competition between the drivers and how hungry they are to win – it feels like everything’s on the line.
||
There are only 20 of us in the world that drive in Formula 1, and this is going to bring that experience to people and give everyone the chance to feel what it’s like to be behind the wheel of one of our cars. I honestly can’t wait.

"['george-russell', 'kimi-antonelli']","['George Russell', 'Kimi Antonelli']",Russell laments British GP where ‘everything went wrong at every single point’,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/russell-laments-british-gp-where-everything-went-wrong-at-every-single-point.1FGlkoyL74ofsGR8mrWOJP,George Russell and Kimi Antonelli reflect on their British Grand Prix experiences from a very wet Silverstone.,"George Russell was left to rue a British Grand Prix where ""everything went wrong at every single point"", as Mercedes had a race to forget at Silverstone.
||
The Briton came home in 10th place on Sunday, having started fourth, as the Silver Arrows' gambles failed to pay off in a Grand Prix that saw a mid-race rain shower, two Virtual Safety Car periods and two full Safety Cars.
||
The first crucial call that backfired occurred before the lights had even gone out – Russell one of five drivers to pit at the end of the Formation Lap for slick tyres. But thanks to a first lap crash involving Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson, an immediate VSC period was called and that hampered Russell’s attempts to keep his hard tyres up to temperature.
||
The Briton did start to make some progress back through the field as the rain fell, his Mercedes looking well balanced in the wet conditions, but then came a second call to move back to the hard tyre again as the track dried.
||
With Fernando Alonso having pitted for slicks half a lap before, it became apparent that Alonso was struggling and soon Russell was also in a similar position.
||
Once again he could not get the C2 rubber up to temperature and spun off into the gravel – fortunately keeping clear of the barriers. In the end he did hold onto P10 at the flag, which was a small consolation from a very disappointing Grand Prix.
||
“Everything just went wrong at every single point to be honest,” Russell explained. ""I feel at the beginning, pitting to slicks was not a stupid decision as we knew it was going to be dry for 25 minutes.
||
“But we had 15 minutes’ worth of [Virtual] Safety Car and that didn’t allow us to warm the tyres, it didn’t allow us to [utilise] the gains of when it was dry. By the end of that stint, we were five seconds a lap faster than the wet runners.
||
“Then at the end maybe I called to pit one or two laps early, but I wasn’t expecting the hard tyre and of course then it all just went wrong. Really disappointing day, if you play it safe, you’ll come home with a safe result and that’s not really what we were going for.”
||
Despite having a new set of mediums, Mercedes didn't fit those or any of the softs onto Russell's car – which Lance Stroll used to good effect in the early stages of the race. And, as Nico Hulkenberg showed with his run from P19 to third, there were big points available to anyone who made the right calls in a dramatic race.
||
“I think at the beginning with the information we had, it was totally justifiable but the call at the end was not right, that’s on me,” Russell concluded.
||
""If you have a fast car, you can afford to do what you want, and you’ll always find yourself in a good position. At the moment unfortunately we don’t have that luxury.""
||
While Russell did at least see the chequered flag, the same couldn't be said for his team mate as Kimi Antonelli was rear-ended by the Racing Bulls car of Isack Hadjar when the visibility was at its worst midway through the race. Although Antonelli was able to limp back to the pits, the damage was too great and he retired the car.
||
“I mean the whole diffuser was gone so it was pretty undriveable the car, it was a shame,” the teenager said.
||
“I was just a passenger but I think Isack, he was also a passenger because he couldn’t see until he was into my back. So yeah, just a shame to have ended with another DNF.”

||
Russell and Mercedes were off the pace across Friday’s pair of practice sessions in pleasant, warm conditions at Silverstone, but returned to the sharp end when temperatures cooled on Saturday.
||
A stellar last Qualifying lap saw Russell come away with a second-row grid slot, behind Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and the two McLaren drivers, and just ahead of Ferrari duo Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc – 0.229s covering that top-six group.
||
Asked to reflect on Qualifying, Russell said: “It was an amazing final lap. Every lap today we were… every lap this whole weekend we’ve been about five-tenths, six-tenths off the pace, sometimes even eight-tenths off the pace.
||
“Getting through Q1 and Q2 was a struggle, and then to finish my last lap only a tenth off pole, 20 milliseconds from the front row, I mean, yeah, I would have definitely taken it!”
||
With similar conditions expected on race day, Russell feels he is firmly in the mix for a podium on home soil, if not more – but reckons there could be half a dozen cars vying for the big prize.
||
“I think we can definitely push for a podium,” he continued. “Obviously the conditions are favourable, but it’s taken us from being off the pace to sort of being there or thereabouts – it hasn’t sort of propelled us to the front.
||
“I think it’s probably fair to say that we overachieved a little bit today, especially in terms of the gaps, we definitely overachieved. Ferrari obviously struggled on that last lap. Tomorrow’s probably going to be a six-way fight.”
||
As for Russell’s team mate, Kimi Antonelli, the Italian was some three-tenths slower en route to seventh position – but he will drop three places on Sunday due to the penalty he picked up for clashing with Max Verstappen in Austria.
||
“It was quite tight out there,” he said of Qualifying. “I’ve been struggling a little bit in the high speed, just struggling to feel the stability and it just killed a bit the confidence, to be honest, throughout the session.
||
“Not easy, but obviously tomorrow with the penalty we’ll try to do our best from there and build from there.”
||
Pushed on what’s still possible, Antonelli added: “Well, hopefully the race pace is going to be good. It’s not going to be easy because it’s pretty tight, but I think if we have a good start and play it smart then we can try to set a good pace and move forward.”

||
After ending Free Practice 1 in fifth place on the timesheets, Russell classified eighth in the second session on a lap seven-tenths off the pace-setting time of McLaren’s Lando Norris.
||
When asked how close he felt to those at the front following Friday’s running, the 27-year-old answered: “Well after today not very close, but it has been warmer today. The track was 40 degrees and we are hoping the rest of the weekend it cools down.
||
“So it is a little frustrating for us that every single week we are at the mercy of the weather and we need to improve that, especially now we are entering the summer months. We are doing everything we can to improve it.
||
“I think our fortunes will turn a little bit and it will come back towards us but, as I said, we can’t be at the mercy of the weather and we are right now.”
||
With Ferrari proving to be McLaren’s closest competitors during Friday, Russell suggested that the Scuderia have taken a step forward.
||
“Ferrari have really turned it up the last couple of races,” the 27-year-old explained. “They’ve been strong in race pace all season really, but they’ve been having bad Qualifyings.
||
“But I think now we are entering summer, everyone is overheating a little bit more and we are probably taking a step backwards, and they’ve taken a step forward purely because of the temperature.
||
“So that’s probably not great for them for some reasons, but it is also not great for us for other reasons too. Anyway, I’m enjoying being here at Silverstone, enjoying seeing all the fans. I love this race weekend and I just hope we can improve for the rest of the week.”
||
Despite having a tricky Friday, Russell responded positively when asked if the arrival of rain or gustier conditions could put Mercedes back in the fight for pole position on Saturday.
||
“Yeah for sure, coldness definitely. If it is wet for Qualifying then definitely excited for that,” the four-time race winner said. “It’s a bit of a unique one because the wet tyres actually deg more than the dry tyres.
||
“It’s like, I don’t want to get too bogged up in the details here but actually a wet race probably wouldn’t be ideal. But we just want it… cold and dry would be ideal.”
||
Kimi Antonelli echoed his team mate’s sentiments about the difficulties of Friday, the Italian having placed P9 and P6 in first and second practice respectively.
||
“[It] was definitely not the easiest today, but I’m having quite a lot of pleasure driving around here,” Antonelli reflected. “Today, temperatures were quite a bit higher than expected.
||
“Overall to be honest the car didn’t feel too bad, there is a little bit to work on and a little bit to work on with the driving. But tomorrow hopefully it is going to be a lot cooler, that is what the forecast is saying, and we’ll see what we can do.”
||
Like Russell, Antonelli is hopeful that Mercedes can be in the battle with Ferrari and McLaren if the temperatures cool as the British Grand Prix event progresses.
||
“Hopefully, that is definitely the goal,” the 18-year-old added. “I think hopefully it is going to cool down. Tomorrow is predicted to be overcast so probably track temp will be a bit cooler. I don’t know by how much, but a little bit cooler and hopefully we can take the fight to Ferrari and the McLarens.”

||
Speculation has mounted for some time over Russell’s future at the outfit, with the 27-year-old’s current deal running until the end of 2025, while Russell himself has also spoken of Mercedes having “conversations” with Max Verstappen.
||
Asked ahead of this weekend’s British Grand Prix if there is any new contract yet, Russell explained: “No updates since the last time we spoke. Honestly, as I’ve said for the majority of this season, I’m just focused on the driving.
||
“It’s a huge weekend for us, for me my home race – it’s my favourite race of the year, and that’s where I want to give all my focus and attention, to try to win this Grand Prix. We were on pole here last year, we were leading the first third of the race.
||
“Temperatures look slightly more favourable for us this weekend – not as favourable as they were this time 12 months ago, but much more compared to Austria last weekend. We know clearly that’s where we struggled, so just excited for that.”
||
Pushed on whether he would question the team’s loyalty more if the contract saga continued to go on, Russell responded: “There’s a lot of conversations behind the scenes that are not public. I know where their loyalty lies and it doesn’t need to be public, it doesn’t need to be broadcasted to everybody.
||
“We’ve obviously spoken a little bit more over the past week because there’s numerous news articles and whatnot out there, but in all honesty it doesn’t really change anything from my side because, as I’ve said before, I feel I’m performing better than ever and it’s as simple as that really. Performance speaks for everything.”
||
And when then asked if he was speaking to any other teams, Russell firmly answered: “No.”
||
Following on from his recent comments about Mercedes having “conversations” with Verstappen, the four-time race winner was quizzed on whether it was right for him to also speak to other teams.
||
“Every team has two seats available, and it’s normal that every team is considering what the future holds,” Russell reflected. “I don’t take that personally, because I made it clear from the beginning I’m happy to be team mates with anybody.
||
“Of course there’s lots of conversations, lots of rumours and all of these are being pointed towards me, but from my side feel that isn’t really going to be the case. I want to continue with Mercedes into the future.
||
“The fact is Toto [Wolff] has never let me down – he’s always given me his word but he’s also got to do what’s right for his team, which includes me but it also includes thousands of people who work for Mercedes.
||
“For me it’s nothing to worry about because I don’t think I’ll be going anywhere, and whoever my team mate will be, it doesn’t concern me either. I’m just focused on the driving.”
||
In terms of how confident he is that there is a contingency plan in place should he not be at Mercedes in 2026, Russell said: “Pretty confident, to be honest, because I think what I’ve proven so far has been plenty enough. Not really much more to say.
||
“Any teams who did reach out in the past, I said I am loyal to Mercedes – that’s where my future lies, and ultimately Mercedes are my managers so it has to be dealt through Mercedes in the first place but there hasn’t been a lack of interest, let’s say.
||
“I’ve been focusing on my side, I am loyal to Mercedes and everything will work itself out. The likelihood I’m not at Mercedes next year I think is exceptionally low.”
||
And while he suggested that there is no specific deadline in place for when his future needs to be decided, Russell hinted that there may be movement within the near future.
||
“There’s not really any deadline in place, to be honest,” the Mercedes driver said. “Naturally you try and have stuff done before the summer break. From my side, Mercedes manage me as well, so it’s not really a deadline in my hands as such.
||
“I’m not even thinking about it – right now obviously there’s a lot of questions about it, but the more we speak about it, the less we speak about it, nothing really changes. It will happen when the time is right. I expect in the next couple of weeks probably something will happen, but we’ll need to wait and see.”

||
The reports rose to the surface in Spielberg amid the situation surrounding George Russell's contract discussions at the Silver Arrows, with the Briton's current deal expiring at the end of 2025.
||
When quizzed in Austria about the process of agreeing a new deal, Russell stated that he was more focused on performance than “pressing massively” to get something signed, despite conceding that “it does help if there was pen on paper”.
||
He also went on to tell Sky Sports F1 that it was ""only normal that conversations with the likes of Verstappen are ongoing"".
||
Verstappen himself also dismissed the talk over the weekend in Austria, instead wanting to focus on racing – while his boss Horner was also questioned about the reports.
||
“It is a lot of noise, and I think Max [Verstappen] gets quite annoyed by it,” Horner told Sky Sports F1.
||
“We are very clear with the contract we have with Max until 2028. Anything is entirely speculative that has been said. We tend to not pay too much attention to it.
||
“I can imagine George is frustrated that he hasn’t been given a contract yet, but that’s between him and his team.

“The situation with Max – we know clearly where we are at, as does Max. Everything is subject to noise and obviously within the contract remains confidential to the two parties.”

||
Off the back of their strongest outing of the season in Canada – which saw Russell claim pole position before taking victory on race day – the Silver Arrows have not fared as well so far in Spielberg, the increasingly warm conditions being just one factor that does not suit the W16.
||
Asked if he was relatively pleased to secure fifth place in Qualifying – given the hot temperatures on Saturday – Russell answered: “Well I won’t be celebrating tonight, but I won’t really be losing much sleep.
||
“It’s the way F1 goes, we know the strengths of our car and we had a really strong weekend in Canada. But, coming here, we knew we weren’t going to be that competitive, with the temperatures, with the high-speed corners.
||
“The tarmac’s very abrasive so the tyres are just having a hard time, and that’s when McLaren come into their own and we fall back.”
||
While Lando Norris surged to pole position – leading the way from the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton in P2 and P4 respectively, with the other papaya car of Oscar Piastri sandwiched between them in third – Russell is joined on the third row by Racing Bulls’ Liam Lawson. The Red Bull of Max Verstappen, meanwhile, sits just behind in seventh.
||
In terms of who he expects to be fighting with on Sunday, Russell predicted: “I think realistically it’s with the Ferraris.
||
“I think Max is generally pretty strong in these conditions, like Barcelona and in Imola, so he’ll probably be coming back through, and ultimately we’ve just got to try and almost [do] damage limitation. Anything more than a P5 would be a pretty strong result but obviously, if there’s chance to go for more, we’ll be going for it.”
||
Two positions back from Verstappen is Russell’s team mate Kimi Antonelli in P9. The Italian appeared to be amongst those affected by a late yellow flag in Qualifying triggered by a spin for Alpine’s Pierre Gasly, meaning that several drivers were unable to complete a final flying run.
||
Looking back at his session – and whether the rising temperatures may have caused Mercedes to struggle more – Antonelli said: “I think also the wind affected us. It was a shame to miss out on the last lap, because I couldn’t complete the lap because of the chequered flag, so it was a shame. Hopefully tomorrow we can have a good race pace in order to move forward.”
||
Despite some of the difficulties so far in matching their rivals, Antonelli – who scored his first F1 podium last time out in Montreal – believes the squad can be more competitive on race day.
||
“Definitely the pace has been quite good, especially also comparing to George,” the 18-year-old added. “Also in FP [Free Practice], the race pace felt strong.
||
“Of course tomorrow we need to check on the temperature and we’re going to be in dirty air, so [that’s] a different story, but hopefully we can move forward.”

""The McLarens were mighty strong, especially this afternoon,"" said Russell. ""I don't really see that changing and that was the anticipation coming into the weekend unfortunately. We'll do our best but I don't think we'll be fighting for pole this weekend.""
||
Mercedes team mate Kimi Antonelli enters the weekend off the back of his best result in F1, having claimed his maiden podium at the previous round in Montreal.
||
The teenage Italian finished 11th in both sessions on Friday and despite struggling for a clean flying lap, believes Mercedes' race pace remains strong.
||
""Definitely the long run was positive and we were pretty close, just towards the end we started to struggle a bit more compared to the McLaren but the first half of the stint was pretty strong,"" he said.
||
""Always very positive but we need to do a good Qualifying in order to start at the front and maybe we can put up a fight.""

||
When quizzed about where the process of agreeing a deal with the Silver Arrows currently stood during Thursday’s media day in Austria, Russell stated that he was more focused on performance than “pressing massively” to get something signed, despite conceding that “it does help if there was pen on paper”.
||
The Briton went on to tell Sky Sports F1 that he could understand if the team were speaking to drivers such as Verstappen, having said: “As Mercedes, they want to be back on top, and if you're going to be back on top you need to make sure you've got the best drivers, the best engineers, the best pit crew, and that's what Mercedes are chasing.
||
""So, it's only normal that conversations with the likes of Verstappen are ongoing. But from my side, if I'm performing as I'm doing, what have I got to be concerned about? There are two seats in every Formula 1 team.""
||
However, with Wolff and Russell both having previously suggested that they want to continue their partnership, Wolff asserted that this was still the case when speaking to media on Friday, whilst recognising that the team still need to have certain conversations.
||
“[We’re] absolutely keen to continue the relationship,” said Wolff. “Everything goes its normal course – we have agreed on timings and we’re absolutely within that framework, and it’s clear silly season starts now. Some conversations you just simply need to have, but it doesn’t change my fundamental opinion about how the team is going to go forwards.”
||
When asked if Russell – whose current deal runs until the end of 2025 – was at the top of Mercedes’ list for 2026, Wolff responded: “Well, he needs to be top of the list because he's a race winner with us. He's a Mercedes junior. He's been with the team for a long time.”
||
Wolff was then quizzed on Russell’s comments about “conversations” with Verstappen and whether, as such, he would expect the 27-year-old to speak to other teams as well.
||
“We are going into territory that I don't want to discuss out here,” the Team Principal explained. “But people talk, people explore, and most important is that in our organisation, we are transparent. But it doesn't change a millimetre of my opinion of George, his abilities, or anything else.”
||
Wolff also added that he had no issue with Russell speaking openly about the situation, commenting: “I like what George says, and I'm always supportive of the driver. There's no such thing as saying things I wouldn't want him to say.
||
“I think we are very transparent in the team for what we do, what we plan, and we've been like that since I was put in charge. So that's not the issue. At the moment, clearly, you need to explore what's happening in the future, but it doesn't change anything of what I said before about George or about Kimi [Antonelli], about the line-up that I'm extremely happy to have.”
||
In terms of whether there was a deadline for the possibility of Verstappen joining Mercedes, Wolff said: “You make it sound like we have been asking when do you want to join and here are the terms. That's not how it is and how it works.
||
“I come back to my previous answer. I just want to have the conversations behind closed doors, not town halls. We have two drivers that have been in our programme since a long time, drivers that I'm perfectly happy to have, drivers that will do great in the future of the team. So it's a bit different, the situation.”
||
Russell and Verstappen – who has a contract to race for Red Bull through to the end of 2028 – have shared some contentious moments on track, including a controversial collision at the Spanish Grand Prix that saw Verstappen receive a 10-second time penalty.
||
Pushed on whether the two drivers could ever race together at Mercedes, Wolff suggested that he would not rule such a pairing out.
||
“I can imagine every line-up. I had [Nico] Rosberg and [Lewis] Hamilton fighting for a World Championship, so everything else afterwards is easy,” the Austrian reflected. “There's pros and cons of having two drivers fighting each other hard. We've seen examples where that functioned and other examples where it didn't.”

||
There has long been speculation over when Russell might agree a new deal with the Silver Arrows, with his current contract running until the end of 2025.
||
Following the Briton’s strong Qualifying performance last time out in Canada, team boss Toto Wolff conceded that Russell was giving the squad “all the reasons” to re-sign him – but the Austrian went on to say that the driver’s victory on race day had no bearing on his future as the team already “know he can perform”.
||
During Thursday’s media day ahead of this weekend’s Austrian Grand Prix, Russell was quizzed on what more he had to do to secure a new contract off the back of his win in Montreal.
||
“You're asking the wrong person, to be honest!” the 27-year-old joked. “Don’t know.”
||
Pushed on how the talks with Wolff were going – and whether they were indeed going – Russell continued: “Yeah, a little bit. No major updates as yet.
||
“It's not something that I'm pressing massively because, as I've always said, the performance is the priority, and I feel with the performance I'm showing at the moment – still in line with the performance I've shown over all these years – I've got zero reasons to be worried. But obviously it does help if there was pen on paper.”
||
The four-time race winner went on to give his take on why the process has not been done yet, as well as reflecting on why he has not felt the need to push to complete contract talks.
||
“I don't need to chase because I feel that I'm doing a good job,” Russell explained. “It goes both ways – I need them, they need me and that's how it goes. Mercedes are so ambitious, they want to be back on top.
||
“They need to understand and think how are they going to bring Mercedes back on top. You need to have the best team principal, you need to have the best drivers in your car, you need to have the best engineers within your team.
||
“Toto has made it clear to me that he thinks how I'm performing this year is as good as anybody. I think there's only one driver that you can debate in terms of performance, these are his words not my words.
||
“So that's why I have no concern about the future, but there's two seats to every team and I guess he needs to think who are those two drivers going to be for those two seats. I guess that's what the delay is.”
||
While Russell and Mercedes enjoyed their strongest weekend of the season so far in Montreal, the British racer is not convinced that they will consistently experience that level of performance going forwards.
||
“I think the performance of Canada was definitely a bit of a one-off,” said Russell. “We were on pole last year in Canada, we probably should have won the race, and our car performs really well when the tyres are not overheating, so on tracks where it's low-speed corners, where it's smooth tarmac, hopefully when the temperature is down.
||
“At fast circuit tracks where it's hot, like Barcelona, like Imola, probably here [in Austria], it's not so good.”

||
Russell enjoyed a strong weekend in Montreal, having claimed pole position in Saturday’s Qualifying before taking both his and the Brackley-based outfit’s first win of the season on Sunday. Team mate Kimi Antonelli added to the celebrations by claiming a maiden podium in third.
||
As such, Wolff – who conceded after Russell’s pole that the 27-year-old was giving the team “all the reasons” to re-sign him – was asked after the race if the result had provided an extra motivation to sign a new contract with Russell, whose current deal runs to the end of 2025.
||
However, the Austrian acknowledged that the British racer has already done enough to prove himself since joining the outfit from Williams back in 2022.
||
“He's been so long with us and he's growing – the steps he's made from that young driver in Williams, then coming to Mercedes at a difficult time, being on par with Lewis [Hamilton], and then since Lewis left being clearly the senior driver in the team, and it comes natural,” Wolff explained.
||
“It's not like there's some politics. He's just taken the place that he merits and deserves. The ambience in the team is great, and we've agreed on some kind of timeline when we want to settle these things.
||
“With triple headers getting out of the way in one race after the other now in June and July… but we're going to get there.
||
“He's been a Mercedes junior in the same way that Kimi was since he was 16, so it isn't dependent on whether he wins a race, whether he performs, because we know he can.”
||
There had been much anticipation prior to Sunday’s race over how the battle between Russell and Max Verstappen might play out, with the pair lining up on the front row together just one race after they controversially collided in Spain.
||
When quizzed on whether this incident might have provided extra motivation for Russell, Wolff reflected: “These two guys [have] sat in go-karts and racing cars [for] more than 10 years, and have fought each other and have known each other off the track as well.
||
“I think they are very civilised when they see each other. It's just on track, it's a fierce battle, different characters, different personalities.
||
“I don't think that is particularly different going into the first corner, whether there's Max aside or George aside, they just want to come out ahead.”

||
Russell had been leading the event from Max Verstappen when Lando Norris dramatically collided with McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri on Lap 67 of 70, resulting in Norris pulling off the track and out of the race.
||
This led to the Safety Car being deployed as the stricken McLaren was recovered. As the vehicle led the pack around the track, Russell accused Verstappen of overtaking him under the Safety Car, while Verstappen commented over the radio: “George erratically braked.”
||
It was later confirmed after the race – which saw Russell take the victory ahead of Verstappen – that Red Bull had protested Russell for “allegedly driving erratically under Safety Car and displaying unsportsmanlike behaviour by complaining that Car 1 had overtaken under Safety Car conditions.""
||
Russell, Verstappen and their respective team representatives were subsequently summoned to the stewards and, after the hearing took place, it was confirmed that the protest had been rejected.
||
A document released following the hearing listed Red Bull’s claim that “during a Safety Car deployment the driver of Car 63 had braked unnecessarily along the back straight between Turns 12 and 13 as a result of which Car 1, which was following Car 63, overtook Car 63 and then dropped back behind Car 63 after Car 63 accelerated.”
||
The Milton Keynes-based outfit also alleged that “by complaining over team radio that Car 1 had overtaken him under Safety Car the driver of Car 63 had ‘displayed unsportsmanlike intent’”.
||
Mercedes’ arguments in defence were also listed, with Russell explaining that “periodic braking is commonplace and to be expected during Safety Car deployments to ensure that temperature is maintained in tyres and brakes.”
||
The Briton also stated that “he braked where he did for two reasons. First to ensure he kept a gap to the Safety Car. Secondly, to keep temperature in his brakes and tyres.” Mercedes also submitted that “what the driver of Car 63 had said over team radio was nothing other than factual.”
||
FIA Sporting Director Tim Malyon – attending on behalf of the FIA – explained that the incident had been observed by Race Control and “assessed to not warrant being reported to the stewards.""
||
He also said that “periodic braking under Safety Car is typical and to be expected”, meaning that Race Control “always allows a degree of tolerance with respect to the 10 car length rule recognising that there is a need for a reasonable degree of braking and acceleration.”
||
After regarding this evidence, the stewards accepted Russell’s explanation of the incident and were satisfied that he “did not drive erratically by braking where he did or to the extent he did”, as well as adding that they did not believe he had engaged in unsportsmanlike conduct by reporting to the team that Verstappen had overtaken.
||
This resulted in the protest being rejected, meaning that the results of the race remained unchanged and Russell's victory was confirmed.

TRACK INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by Nico Rosberg)
||
Q: George, what an amazing drive by you and by the team this whole weekend. Was that the best one of your whole career?
||
George RUSSELL: It's amazing to be back on the top step. Obviously, last time for us was back in Vegas. I felt last year was a victory lost. And then obviously we got the victory today probably due to the incredible pole yesterday. And obviously, so happy to see Kimi on the podium as well. So amazing day for the team. Thanks to everybody back at the factory who's been working so hard to get us back fighting for victories. And yeah, it feels good.
||
Q: Has something fundamental changed on the car, or what’s going on now? Is Mercedes back?
||
GR: No. It's a little bit cooler around here. You know, we saw it last year in Canada. I'd love to get our hopes up, but I think the strength of our car is in these cooler conditions and, you know, let's see going into the coming races, but we'll just enjoy it for now.
||
Q: So you're not quite sure? You don't think you can maybe keep this going for the next race?
||
GR: Time will tell. Time will tell. I mean, we won Austria last year, so maybe that's a good omen. But, you know, we'll enjoy it for the time being. We did have high expectations coming into this weekend, and it worked out as we thought. So yeah. Good day. Good day.
||
Q: Max, P2. Was that the maximum, do you think, this weekend?
||
Max VERSTAPPEN: Yeah, I think so. It was quite a good race even though I think the two stints we were struggling quite a bit on the tyres. So we were doing quite an aggressive strategy. But luckily in that final stint, we managed to hang in there and actually the pace was a bit better on the bit lower fuel load. So that was good. I think we drove an attacking/defending race—attacking with a strategy, defending of course with the cars behind. But it worked out for us and I think that was the maximum possible for us today.
||
Q: On a day like today, do you still think about the championship though, because it’s good points you made up – some on Piastri and a lot on Lando?
||
MV: It’s a long, long season, you know. So you need to go race by race, and we'll always do the best we can.
||
Q: Looking forward to your Red Bull home race with all your fans in Austria?
||
MV: Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's always a great weekend there. We've had a lot of great results, and hopefully, we can have another strong weekend there.
||
Q: Kimi Antonelli, you are a Formula 1 podium race finisher. You did it! Is that awesome?
||
Kimi ANTONELLI: I mean, it was so stressful, but super happy. Had a good start, I managed to jump into P3. And yeah, just stayed up there at the front. And the last stint, I pushed a bit too hard behind Max, and I killed a bit the front left. I struggled a bit at the end, but really happy to bring the podium home.
||
Q: Everybody is chanting your name! You have so many supporters here! We just watched your pass on Piastri, which is what set you up for the podium. Take us through that.
||
KA: Yeah. I mean, I had a good launch, and I managed to get alongside. And then in the corner, I just tried to carry as much speed as possible. And then when I was alongside him in T2, I knew I would have had the advantage, especially going into T3, and really happy to stick that.
||
Q: It looks like Mercedes is maybe back. Your car looks awesome. Are we going to see a race win from you next?
||
KA: I mean, that’s the goal. But yeah, definitely, this track has been good for us. The car has been incredible all weekend. And yeah, hopefully, we can carry the same momentum into the next few races.
||
PRESS CONFERENCE
||
Q: George, off the back of a tough triple header for the team, just how satisfying is this result?
||
George RUSSELL: Yeah, it's been great to get the win and, you know, seeing Kimi up here as well on the podium. Really, really pleased for him. And, you know, as a team, we've been performing so well this year. Up until the last triple header, we'd maximized every single race weekend, whether, you know, that was the P2 in Bahrain or the other podiums we had. But coming into Canada, we knew we did have the potential to fight for pole and for the race win, and, ultimately, it came down to that quali lap yesterday. There was obviously not much movement in terms of positions shuffling around but really pleased with the job.
||
Q: Given the hot temperatures today, were you surprised by the pace and the consistency of the car?
||
GR: I was, to be honest. There wasn't much tyre overheating even though it was hot. It's a very smooth tarmac here in Canada. There are quite low speed corners, so the tyres aren't under much stress. I think we expected a bit more tyre overheating considering the track temperature, but we're under no illusions that this really suited the strengths of our car the same way as it did last year. But for the majority of the circuits, we know it's a bit of a challenge, and that's why this is the first weekend both of us are on the podium. But it's great to see that when we get that chance, we take it.
||
Q: You say the rear tyres weren't under much stress. Were you under much stress having Max in your mirrors for most of it?
||
GR: No. Not really. To be honest, for the last couple of weeks, obviously, there's lots of noise going on, after what happened in Spain as well. But from my side, you put it to one side, and you know that if you make a good start, you get into a groove. I knew I had potentially the fastest car today, you've got to dial into that and put all of the additional noise to one side. And, of course, it was a bit challenging at points when you had Charles and Lando on the offset strategy, and they were kind of getting in our way. But as soon as I had clear air, I could comfortably pull the gap out. It wasn't dead easy, but I felt confident in myself and the car. I was keeping a close eye on how Kimi was getting on, and on the TVs, and seeing Lando and Oscar closing down. But, no, it was a good day, and I feel proud of myself, feel proud of the team, especially after this time 12 months ago when it was a victory lost.
||
Q: Now, George, you're still without a contract for 2026. Weekends like this must help the negotiations, right?
||
GR: It doesn't hurt! It doesn't hurt at all. But, you know, as I've said many times, I'm not concerned at all about next year. I know I'm going to be on the grid next year. I feel that I'm driving better than ever. I still feel I've got more in the tank. I feel ready to fight for a world championship, and I think results like today, results like Bahrain this year when we got half a chance of a good result, we're there to take it. And I'm pretty relaxed. Just enjoying the moment, enjoying my racing, and just taking it week by week.
||
Q: Max, let's come to you. Very well done as well. You were close to George throughout. Without the Safety Car at the end, might an opportunity have arisen to go for the win?
||
MV: No. Not really, to be honest. The first two stints, I was struggling a lot with the tyres. Just too much degradation again. So we drove quite a defensive race, to be honest, because basically two times, Kimi was about to overtake me, and we boxed. So that worked out quite well for me. We did a very aggressive strategy. I think the last pit stop, I was a bit worried if I was going to make it to the end competitively because on the hard tyre in the second stint, I was already struggling as well. So I think just a lighter fuel load helped a bit. But the gap wasn't that big towards George, and I never really felt like I had the pace to do anything. It was more about just looking in the mirror, trying to maintain that gap, try to look after my tyres to not overstress them. It was not the easiest race, but I think as a team we managed it well. I think we definitely optimised everything we could because, honestly, throughout the whole race, I never really felt like I was actually holding on to second. So, yeah, we did a good job. I mean, the whole weekend, I think the car was reasonable. Strategy-wise, we did the best we could.
||
Q: Does that give you a lot of confidence going forward?
||
MV: Well, I hope that we can start every weekend like this in terms of how I feel with the car, but overall, we do need more performance to be quick everywhere. I also think that this weekend was a bit, I won't say an off weekend, but McLaren wasn't as strong as normal. And, of course, we benefited a little bit. But if we go to all the other tracks now coming up, we definitely need more performance to even be close to them. This has been a good weekend for us, but we need a lot more to be able to fight with them for the whole season.
||
Q: Kimi, you've done it. Your first podium in Formula 1. What does this third place mean to you?
||
KA: It meant a lot, especially after a difficult triple header on my side. Definitely took some confidence away, but this was the best way to bounce back.
||
Q: It was far from easy. There was a lot of pressure, particularly from Oscar Piastri in those closing laps. What were you thinking in those moments as he was getting into your DRS?
||
KA: I was just hoping for the race to finish, to be honest. I was even looking at the screen counting the laps because it was very stressful. In the last stint, I pushed a bit too hard behind Max and eventually degraded the front left. The last few laps were a struggle, especially seeing Oscar getting closer and closer in the DRS range. At one point, he even tried to attempt the overtake in turn one. It took a lot of effort.
||
Q: So, what does this do to your confidence going forward? Do you feel you're in a better place now as a result of this weekend?
||
KA: Yeah, definitely. I mean, I'm still aware there's a lot of work to do, especially when it comes to qualifying, trying to be quicker at the beginning of the session. But we're on a good path. The team is doing a great job. Also, with George, he's helping me to push myself even further. There's a really good dynamic in the team. Hopefully, we can carry this momentum into the next few races.

||
QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR
||
Q: (Stu Cowan – Montreal Gazette) Question for George. What's the added significance of this victory maybe with the fact it comes on Father's Day?
||
GR: Yeah. It's definitely a special moment to win on Father's Day because, I mean, for all of us, our fathers have been such huge figures in our life and racing career. My father was at a go-kart track today with my eight-year-old nephew, go-karting, and starting journey number three of motorsport after myself and my older brother. And, you know, they got back after probably a six-hour-long drive this evening to watch the Grand Prix and then to win for him, the whole team, it's really special and it means a lot.
||
Q: (Ben Hunt – Autosport/Motorsport) Just a question for you, George. Your contractual situation – are you 100% certain that it's going to be Mercedes next year, or are you talking to other teams as well?
||
GR: No. I'm not talking with anybody else and any teams who have shown interest, I have been quite open to say my intentions are to stay with Mercedes. That's always been clear. And I am loyal to Mercedes. They gave me this chance to get into Formula 1. There haven't been any hard feelings with any of the talks that have been going around, especially around Max. Because, like I said on numerous times, why wouldn't teams be interested in Max? If every driver had no contracts for next year, Max would be number one for every single team. And that's understandable. But ultimately, there are two seats for every race team. I knew if I continue to perform as I'm doing, my position would not be under threat whatsoever. So, I feel in a good place. We're in no rush to do contract negotiations. We want to win together. Especially Kimi and I being team-mates now – we're getting a result like today, both junior drivers from Mercedes, we're both doing the job in terms of performance. Why would you want to change something that's working?
||
Q: (Ticiano Figueiredo – Diário do Rio Claro) Max, yesterday I asked you how much of your weekend's performance was due to the car and how much came from the lion unleashed. Today after this race, and especially after what happened between Lando and Oscar in the final laps, I'd like to change my question. How hopeful can we be about witnessing a generation battle – a direct title fight between you and Oscar this year?
||
MV: A lot needs to happen for that, to be honest. We need to start winning races more often. And how do we do that? By being more competitive. Now, this was a good weekend, but again, not competitive enough. Like I said before, we have our moments where maybe we can win here or there, but we just need to make the car faster. Then we make it a lot easier for ourselves. We're working hard on it with the team. Of course, bits are coming, but is it going to be enough? I don't know. It's small margins in this world that can give you better results every single weekend. But what I think so far, what McLaren has shown this whole season is quite extraordinary and difficult to beat. So now, okay, one weekend is not as good, but they are still by far the favourites. And that's not going to be something that is easily beaten. But the coming races, we really want to try and improve our car.
||
Q: (Phil Duncan – PA) Congrats on the win, George. Earlier you said you're ready to fight for a world championship, and you've got more in the tank. Do you think there's an outside chance that could be this year? You've obviously taken 12 points out of Oscar today, and Lando didn't score. So, yeah, do you think you're in the mix?
||
GR: I mean, to be honest, I don't really know how Max and I are so close to those two because they clearly have the most dominant car. I think the two of us have been very consistent and getting the maximum result from our packages week in, week out. But I can't imagine them to continue throwing away points in the manner they're doing. Of course, we hope that continues to be the case, but I don't foresee us getting in the championship fight through pure pace as Lando did last year. We'll only be there if results like today continue or things like today continue to happen.
||
Q: (Rodrigo França – Car Magazine, Brazil) Question to Kimi. Congratulations on your podium. How was the feeling on the podium? The cooldown room, the taste of champagne, the view from the podium – was it like you imagined when you were go-karting? And also, could George remind us how his first podium felt?
||
KA: Well, it was much better than what I imagined. Hearing the crowd while walking onto the podium, I had massive goosebumps. That is definitely a moment I will remember for a very long time. It gives you a boost – results like this and this feeling, you can't buy this feeling. It's an amazing feeling and you just want more. I think the goal now is to try to keep the same momentum and try to achieve more podiums, and hopefully maybe the first win – you never know in the future.
||
Q: George, memories of your first podium?
||
GR: My first podium obviously came in Belgium 2021, which was a bit of a unique race and very stressful for many different reasons, because scoring points for us as a team was far more important than the result itself. But it's a day you remember forever. I remember that day in Spa. I'm sure many people remember that day in Spa. I'm really happy to see Kimi here because it's a lot of hard work. As he said, the triple header was tough for both of us for different reasons. But to come back – he showed a really solid race, had good race pace. That's what we need to do as a team to continue getting these points and try to finish P2 in the constructors’.
||
Q: (Daniel Valente – The Score) Question for Kimi and Max. Now we have the third youngest and the youngest podium finishers in F1 history here. So Kimi, how has Max helped inspire your journey? And Max, what exceptional qualities have you seen in Kimi?
||
KA: Racing in F1 with the 19 other best drivers on the grid gives you a lot of motivation. Having the chance to race at your best and show what you're capable of is a great boost. Of course, seeing what Max has done over the years, especially in his rookie years, was quite astonishing. So definitely he's a model who I get inspired by. But at the end, racing against the best is a great chance. And having someone like George as a team-mate really helps you improve. It's also down to George this result because he has helped me during this first part of the season to develop and push myself even further.
||
MV: For me, it's not a surprise. I knew Kimi coming up through the karting ranks – people were already saying great things. So I was keeping an eye on him. I think what's impressive is he's naturally quick. What I like is his level-headed, calm approach. Those are great qualities to have. I was never in doubt that the podium would come this year. He had a few unlucky races – one of them in the sprint was also my fault with the pit stop. But it was just a matter of time. I'm very happy that it happened for him. It gives you more confidence. It's a nice boost. And it will only get better. You're in your rookie season – there's so many things that will come at you. You learn from the weaker races, you learn from the good ones. In the coming years, for sure, we'll see a lot more of Kimi.
||
Q: (Vittorio Giordano – Cittadino Canadese) For Kimi. Congratulations on your first podium. It's been 16 years since we saw an Italian driver on the podium. Last time was Jarno Trulli in 2009. What's your feeling about that and this achievement, in Montreal where there is a huge Italian community – 1.5 million Canadians of Italian origin?
||
KA: It's obviously a great feeling to be the next Italian on the podium after such a long time. Now the next goal is to win, to bring Italy back on top. This result was needed. It's also for all the Italian Tifosi out there. Imola was an incredible weekend for me in terms of support. It didn’t go as well as I wanted, but seeing so much support already early on is great. So, this result is also for them.
||
Q: (Georgia Kolev – TSN) Question for George. Congrats on the win today. If you could choose a song to represent your win today, what would it be?
||
GR: Oh my god! A song to represent my win – wow! That is such a great question, but I'm just going to embarrass myself with whatever I say here. Let me get back to you.
||
MV: Check your Spotify playlist.
||
GR: It’s going to be a bit too much Taylor Swift if you look at my Spotify playlist.
||
Q: (Tom Carey – Telegraph) George, apologies if you answered this earlier – I missed the start. But are you going for a swim now? I think I saw a video of you earlier saying that you would if you won.
||
GR: That took you long enough. For sure. So, we have this crazy German who's living in Los Angeles who has rejoined us this weekend. He's a friend of Valtteri's and is probably an inspiration for Valtteri's nude calendars and the mullet and all of this stuff. He's in the room with us today, and he’s the one who said, “If I win, we need to jump in the lake.” So yeah, thanks for the reminder.
||
MV: You should do the calendar.
||
GR: Well, I’m considering the calendar. You know? If I don’t have a contract next year, I need to bring the calendar out to bring the income in. So yeah, maybe. Is it clean? Could somebody let me know? He's shaking his head. Is it clean or not? Oh god!

The Brackley outfit have struggled to consistently keep pace with their frontrunner rivals, but the cooler temperatures and smoother surface in Montreal played perfectly into their hands and helped Russell to secure his first pole and win of the year.

He controlled the race from lights out, executing a two-stop strategy after enduring some early pressure from the lead Red Bull, with Verstappen never allowing the Briton too much breathing room throughout the 70 laps.
||
Although he expected more of a challenge from the championship leader, Oscar Piastri was ultimately restricted to P4 after Antonelli passed him on the opening lap, and a late collision with Lando Norris meant that the race ended behind the Safety Car which confirmed Russell’s victory.
||
“It’s amazing to be back on the top step, obviously the last time for us was back in Vegas,” he later said. “I thought last year for us was a victory lost, and then obviously we got the victory today probably due to the incredible pole lap yesterday.
||
“So happy to see Kimi on the podium as well so it’s an amazing day for the team – thanks to everybody back at the factory who’s been working so hard to get us back fighting for victories. It feels good.”

RACE START: Watch the getaway in Montreal as Russell maintains the lead over Verstappen

||
Parts of the weekend echoed the 2024 Canadian Grand Prix, when the Mercedes driver also claimed pole position ahead of Verstappen, but tricky mixed weather conditions meant that he lost out and dropped back to P3.
||
This season’s redemption drive at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve represents the team’s best result, with the 1-3 finish solidifying their second place status in the teams’ standings. Nevertheless, Russell was uncertain that the momentum will be carried forward to the next few rounds in Europe.
||
Asked whether anything fundamental had changed, he responded: “No, it’s a little bit cooler around here – we saw it last year here in Canada.

||
After taking P1 on the grid for last year’s race in Montreal, Russell followed this up by doing so again for the 2025 event, the Briton beating Red Bull’s Max Verstappen by 0.160s with a lap of 1m 10.899s.

||
Speculation swirled earlier in the season over whether Russell was about to extend his stay with the Silver Arrows, with his current deal running to the end of 2025. When quizzed about this on Sky Sports F1, after the 27-year-old’s stunning pole at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, team boss Wolff conceded: “He’s giving us all the reasons to do that quickly.
||
“We know what he’s capable of doing and he has been leading this team now since a while. He has the pace and the right attitude. He’s been a Mercedes junior [for] such a long time, and we are on track in doing what we’ve always planned.”
||
While Mercedes have collected their fair share of pole positions over the years – having achieved this a whopping 134 times since returning to F1 as a constructor in 2010 – Wolff admitted that Russell’s P1 in Canada ranked as one of the best.
||
“[It’s] right up there because if you look at the competitive field, with Max on the medium [tyre] as well, the McLarens, the Ferraris strong, and he was able to pull a lap off,” said Wolff. “I think he was the only one in the 1m 10s. Very, very, very strong lap from him.”
||
READ MORE: Russell hails Canada pole lap as ‘one of the most exhilarating of my life’ as he looks ahead to fight with Verstappen
||
In terms of whether the lap came to Russell through the session or if the squad had been making adjustments too, the Team Principal explained: “We were so competitive in the free practice sessions that we were almost a bit surprised.
||
“At the beginning of Qualifying it wasn’t coming easy, and then on the last two runs on the soft [tyre] it just kept coming, and on the medium you could see, I guess as a driver you almost come into this buzz within yourself. The delta time was going quicker and quicker, so it was a mega lap.”
||
Looking ahead to Sunday’s race, all eyes will be on how Russell and Verstappen go racing off the back of their collision last time out in Spain, an incident that resulted in Verstappen receiving a 10-second time penalty as well as picking up three penalty points on his licence.
||
“We need these situations anyway so everybody’s looking forward to having these two ahead,” Wolff commented on the potential battle between the pair.

“Today was awesome in front of this amazing crowd,” smiled Russell. “To be honest that last lap was probably one of the most exhilarating laps of my life, because on my steering wheel you've got the delta and I just saw every corner I was going one-tenth quicker, one-tenth quicker.

FP2: Russell narrowly leads Norris and Antonelli in Canada after Stroll strikes the wall

||
Their low point came in Monaco when neither Russell nor Kimi Antonelli finished in the top 10, but the cooler conditions at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve have so far seemed to suit their car as both drivers occupied the top three at the end of FP2, split only by Lando Norris.
||
The improved result came as the field struggled with the lack of grip around the track, with many failing to make the corners and either taking to run-off areas or making contact with the wall, like Charles Leclerc in FP1.
||
Russell was able to find the necessary balance early in the second session, and later said: “It might be my first time top of the leaderboard the whole year! 10 races in… no, obviously we’ve had a very positive day.
||
“We had higher expectations coming into this weekend because of the cooler conditions. The track’s quite smooth so the tyres naturally run quite cold and we know our weakness, which is when it’s hot, we struggle and when it’s cold, the tyres run cold, we’re pretty competitive.

“That was definitely validation today. Nevertheless, we’ll try to maximise this weekend. I think my lap was really strong today, probably optimised. There was nothing more in the tank there.
||
“We had it all on the table – full beans, power and all the rest so let’s see what tomorrow brings. You’ve got to be a little bit realistic. We’ll see tomorrow, it’ll be interesting.
||
""Clearly, a number of teams are thinking about this medium tyre as well so come Qualifying, do you go on the soft? Do you go on the medium? That’s one of the challenges so far when we’ve had this C6 compound.”
||
Antonelli, who improved 10 positions from P13 in FP1 to third in FP2, similarly faced difficulties in recent rounds when it came to the softer tyre, but said that his time on track in Canada has already increased his confidence levels.
||
“It was a good day, a decent day to be honest,” he summarised. “This track is pretty fun, it’s not easy but so far I’ve been enjoying it quite a lot. I’m pretty happy because I’m understanding more and more the C6, which was the main point for me after the two difficult weekends in Imola and Monaco.

“The progress has been there – obviously there’s still quite a bit of work to do but a single lap felt pretty okay, and then the long run felt good as well. We’ll try to keep pushing in order to improve for tomorrow.
||
“The car felt strong today and the pace was definitely there. [The conditions] help everybody a bit, but for us the car is definitely very connected.

||
When a Safety Car was called late in the race following a mechanical issue for Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli, most of the field took the opportunity to pit. This included Verstappen, but the World Champion re-emerged with a set of hard tyres on the RB21 – the only option he had remaining – which put him at a disadvantage in comparison to his rivals on the soft rubber.
||

||
Charles Leclerc overtook him for third at the restart before Russell attempted to make a move, which resulted in Verstappen having to take to the escape road after brief contact between them. Red Bull then instructed the Dutch driver to give the position back to Russell, leading to a second moment of contact that earned Verstappen a 10-second time penalty.
||
Verstappen admitted on social media the next day that the move “was not right and shouldn't have happened”, and Horner has since disclosed that the driver also offered his apologies over what happened to the team.
||
“It happened in the debrief,” Horner explained to Sky Sports F1 as the Canadian Grand Prix weekend got underway. “Obviously it was a very frustrating race for him and of course for the team. It was one of those things, he accepted that with hindsight I’m sure he wouldn’t have done it, but there was a whole bunch of circumstances that led up to it.
||
“You always talk about these things in private and Max apologised to the team. He knows that the penalty that went with that was severe, and you’re always learning in this life and there will be lessons taken from that race for sure.”
||
READ MORE: Hadjar ‘very curious’ to see what he can do in a Red Bull but admits call up would be ‘scary’
||
Horner went on to suggest that the passion with which Verstappen drives bears comparison to some of the sport’s past World Champions.
||
“Look, he’s a driver that drives with a huge amount of emotion, and part of what gives him the brilliance he has is the emotion that he drives with,” the Briton reflected. “He wears his heart on his sleeve and occasionally you make misjudgements – we’ve seen it with all the greats, whether it was [Ayrton] Senna or [Michael] Schumacher, all the great champions over the years.
||
“I think the most important thing was he came back, he immediately apologised to the team, and it was frustrating because obviously he lost a lot of points on that day.”
||
Horner was then pushed on whether Red Bull made the right calls, in terms of asking Verstappen to concede position to Russell as well as pitting him for the hard tyre rather than leaving him on track.
||
“You’ve got to rewind it right back,” the Team Principal said. “We went on to a three-stop strategy which was playing out beautifully – it was the better strategy to be on, but of course the danger with that is it leaves you with very little tyre choice available in the event of a Safety Car in that last stint.
||
READ MORE: Horner vows to give Tsunoda time at Red Bull after 'flashes of performance'
||
“So the choice the team faced was either stay out on the eight-lap-old tyres that he had that he’d smashed pretty hard trying to get an undercut on Lando [Norris], at which point both McLarens would have had a free stop, he would have had track position, but they would have easily eaten him up, or do we take a new hard?
||
“As a team we decided to take that new tyre versus a heavily used soft tyre. The risk with that was the warm-up; the Safety Car stayed out a reasonable length of time, Max had a big snap on the restart – he did amazingly well to gather that up, which then gave Charles a run at him.
||
“His next lap was actually the fastest lap he did of the race, but it’s all marginal decisions that you have to make in a split second. Of course, with hindsight you could say if we’d have stayed out on the softs we’d have probably finished third – we’d have had track position.
||
“Would Charles have passed us? I don’t know, possibly not, but you can only make the decisions that you have at the moment in time. With a new set of tyres available versus an eight-lap-old scrubbed, it seemed a reasonable decision.”

The fact that Verstappen received three penalty points for the incident with Russell has put him just one point away from a one-race suspension. But when asked who the team would replace him with should this happen – following the news that Red Bull Junior Arvid Lindblad was recently granted a Super Licence – Horner suggested that the squad have various options.
||
“Arvid Lindblad is at the very beginning of his journey in Formula 1, having been granted that licence,” he stated. “First of all it’s a situation that we want to desperately try and avoid, and should it come we’ve got enough drivers to draw upon from the pool of Red Bull drivers.

||
The Red Bull driver, however, had only been left with a set of hard tyres, meaning that he was at a disadvantage to many of those around him on the soft compound.
||
As such, Verstappen was overtaken for P3 by Charles Leclerc on the main straight at the restart – where the pair briefly banged wheels in the process – before Russell then tried to make a move into Turn 1, the Mercedes also making contact with Verstappen which sent the Dutchman down the escape road.
||
When Red Bull told Verstappen to hand the position back to Russell, there was a second moment of contact between the two which earned Verstappen a 10-second time penalty, dropping him from P5 at the flag down to a final result of P10.

Verstappen wrote on social media the next day: “Our tyre choice at the end and some moves after the [Safety Car] restart fuelled my frustration, leading to a move that was not right and shouldn't have happened.”

When asked during Thursday’s media day in Montreal whether he had any further reflections on the incident – as well as being quizzed on Russell’s revelation that there were “no issues” between the pair when they recently ran into each other at the airport – Verstappen answered: “Yeah, well not after the race immediately but we saw each other.

The incident in Spain also resulted in Verstappen’s total number of penalty points rising to 11 – meaning that he is just one point away from the 12-point threshold that results in an automatic one-race suspension.
||
In terms of whether this will be on his mind during the weekend ahead in Canada, the 27-year-old said: “It’s there right, there’s nothing I can do about it, so we just focus ahead and try to do the best we can every single time. It’s not changing my approach and I cannot speak for others.”

And when asked how much missing a race would hurt, he responded: “If you look at it in general, yeah, missing a race is not ideal, but it’s not the end of the world.”

“I wish we would be as competitive as we were of course in the past, but I think the world has been a bit different for us at the moment,” the Red Bull man conceded.

||
Having rejoined ahead of Russell, the Dutchman was told by his Red Bull team to let the Briton through, eventually backing off on the exit of Turn 4 before accelerating and colliding with Russell through the following left-hand turn.
||
The reigning World Champion eventually conceded the position and finished fifth on the road, but a 10-second penalty for the collision dropped him to 10th, as he later posted on Instagram the following day that it was ""a move that was not right and shouldn’t have happened"".
||
Speaking ahead of the Canadian Grand Prix this weekend, Russell explained that he believed Verstappen was ""just trying to get his elbows out and show who's boss"" rather than it being a deliberate, premeditated act and insisted there were no issues between the pair.
||
""Obviously it would have been a different feeling had it taken me out of the race but ultimately I benefitted from it and he was penalised,"" said Russell.

As well as the time penalty, Verstappen was also handed three penalty points on his licence, which means he sits just a single point away from a one-race ban.
||
It means the Dutchman will need to make it through the Canadian and Austrian weekends without incident to avoid being left on the sidelines before two of those 11 points will be wiped after a 12-month period.
||
When asked whether it was right the reigning World Champion might be forced to miss a race, Russell pointed out the regulations were the same for everyone.
||
""I think that's how it should be in racing,"" he explained. ""At the end of the day if you take on risky moves and you get it wrong you get penalised and, if you get your points, you'll be banned for a race.

""I'm not going to sit here and say X, Y, Z because it's ultimately not really my problem. It's his problem. I'm looking forward to the weekend and then go from there. That's racing.""

Ahead of the Canadian Grand Prix, Verstappen was also asked about the incident and how being on the brink of a ban would change his approach this weekend.
||
""There’s nothing I can do about it so we just focus ahead and try to do the best we can every single time,"" he said. ""It’s not changing my approach and I cannot speak for others.

“If you look at it in general, yeah, missing a race is not ideal but it’s not the end of the world.”

['kimi-antonelli'],['Kimi Antonelli'],Antonelli adamant he’s ‘not really worried’ as Mercedes rookie is questioned on contract reports,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/antonelli-adamant-hes-not-really-worried-as-mercedes-rookie-is-questioned-on.1bdVeOqxU6tiphH7asXHod,Kimi Antonelli is confident that he will have “time to grow” at Mercedes as ‘silly season’ rumours swirl in the Silverstone paddock.,"Kimi Antonelli has no concerns over his Formula 1 future with Mercedes, despite the Italian rookie and experienced team mate George Russell not yet being confirmed at the Silver Arrows for the 2026 season.
||
Antonelli is almost halfway through his debut campaign after replacing seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton in Mercedes’ driver line-up – highlights so far including a Sprint pole in Miami and podium finish in Canada.
||
However, neither 18-year-old Antonelli nor 27-year-old Russell have been announced as Mercedes drivers beyond 2025, as media reports continue to link F1 title holder Max Verstappen with Toto Wolff’s squad.
||
With Russell recently speaking of “conversations” between Mercedes and Verstappen, and the Briton’s assertion that “I don’t think I’ll be going anywhere”, Antonelli was asked where he stands with the team and his future.
||
“I’m not really worried about myself, I’m just trying to focus as much as possible on what I have to do to deliver the best performance as possible,” explained Antonelli. “I think the team has given me a lot of trust and is still doing so, and they’re also giving me time to grow.
||
“On my side, I think last weekend was not the best, but at the same time I’m really trying to work on my weak points, to try and reduce the [number] of mistakes.
||
“Of course, there’s a lot going on and a lot of talks, but at the end of the day, I’m just trying to focus on myself and deliver the best job as possible.”
||
Antonelli was then quizzed on the amicable scenes between himself and Verstappen after the youngster ran into the back of the Dutchman’s car on the opening lap last time out in Austria – and the importance of keeping good relations should they become team mates going forward.
||
“To be honest, I wasn’t really thinking about that,” he said. “I think it was just a way to show respect and to also... I acknowledge straight away that I did a mistake and obviously it was on me.
||
“I was sorry towards my team as well, because finishing a race on Lap 1 is never good, but also I took out Max, which was obviously not the plan. It was not on purpose and I just felt sorry towards him as well.
||
“Definitely I went to apologise to show respect and that I was sorry about what happened, but he was very nice towards me as well – he was very open and he understood my message.”
||
As for the weekend ahead, Antonelli is excited to get back behind the wheel at a Silverstone Circuit that brought his maiden Formula 2 victory last season.
||
“I’m very excited ahead of this weekend,” he commented. “I think Silverstone is always a very special one because the atmosphere is just incredible.
||
“I think it’s a good weekend to bounce back, especially after the difficult race in Austria, so I’m very excited to hit the track tomorrow and see what we’re going to be able to do.”

['kimi-antonelli'],['Kimi Antonelli'],‘These mistakes happen’ – Wolff defends Antonelli after Verstappen clash on tough Austria weekend for Mercedes,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/these-mistakes-happen-wolff-defends-antonelli-after-verstappen-clash-on.1Gzth74up2UG9q0zMuVE11,Mercedes endured a difficult Austrian Grand Prix as Kimi Antonelli crashed out on the first lap and George Russell finished a distant fifth.,"Toto Wolff was left to rue a challenging Austrian Grand Prix for Mercedes after Kimi Antonelli’s first-lap collision with Max Verstappen and George Russell’s lonely run to fifth position.
||
Winners last time out at the Canadian Grand Prix, Mercedes continued where they left off with a pace-setting display in first practice at the Red Bull Ring, but that would prove to be the high point of their weekend.
||
After Qualifying fifth and ninth respectively, Mercedes’ hopes of turning the situation around were severely dented at the start of the race when Antonelli lost control of his car under braking for Turn 3 and collected Red Bull rival Verstappen.
||
From there, Russell was the Silver Arrows’ sole representative and had to settle for converting his starting position – finishing a minute behind the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.
||
Asked to reflect on the race, beginning with Antonelli’s incident, which earned the rookie a three-place grid drop, Mercedes boss Wolff said: “We always knew that eventually… No, I word it differently. These mistakes happen.
||
“The rears blocked on the car. I’m not entirely sure it was his [Antonelli’s] fault or a system. I haven’t seen any data or heard anything, because obviously we were concentrating on the race. But that happens, you know.
||
“It’s unfortunate for Max and Red Bull that Kimi hit him, but it’s racing.”
||
Asked if he had spoken with Antonelli about what happened, Wolff shared: “Yeah, he came into the garage quickly. I said, ‘Well, that wasn’t great’, which he obviously knew, but he said the tyres just blocked and we need to analyse that.
||
“It’s a shame that Max… that we took another car out with us, but that can happen to the great ones, to the inexperienced ones, to the experienced ones – it’s just part of F1.”
||
Wolff then reflected on Mercedes’ wider weekend performance, having gone from pole position and victory with Russell in cooler Montreal conditions to finishing third-best behind McLaren and Ferrari amid the Spielberg heat.
||
“When you look at our performance last year, we won, we won the race here,” said Wolff, pointing to Russell capitalising on Verstappen and Norris’ clash. “We were, I don’t remember, 10-15 seconds behind the leaders, and that was a very solid performance.
||
“This year we’re a minute behind the leaders, so that is clearly out of the ordinary what happened today. We do experiment at the moment a little bit, how to position, how to put the car on track, where we put the balance, and clearly this one we got wrong – and we know that.
||
“I think it’s not only down to asphalt, long corners and heat. Clearly that’s not our sweet spot, but it doesn’t explain the gap, and I think we know why, but in hindsight you always know.”
||
Mercedes dropped back to third in the Teams’ Championship standings following Sunday’s race, a point behind Ferrari, who scored strongly with Charles Leclerc in P3 and Lewis Hamilton in P4.

||
After starting from P9 on the grid, Antonelli locked up the rear brakes of his Mercedes into Turn 3, causing him to hit Verstappen’s Red Bull which put both cars out of the race.
||
Both were summoned to the stewards over the incident, where the verdict was that Antonelli was “fully at fault” for what happened, though it was also acknowledged that the move had been a “result of the evasive action after locking up”.
||
Given that the teenager was unable to continue in the race, the penalty decided upon was a three-place grid drop for the next race – that being Silverstone next weekend on July 4-6 – as well as two penalty points on his licence.
||
A document released following the stewards’ meeting states: “In the hearing the driver admitted that he made a mistake as he locked up the rear wheels while using his regular braking point, but also pointed out that he needed to avoid a collision with Car 30 [Liam Lawson] in front of him and released the brakes for a short period of time to do so.
||
“Taking evasive action led to the car having less grip on the dirty inside line and therefore he was not able to decelerate the car in a way to avoid the collision with Car 1.
||
“The stewards determine that, although the incident happened in Lap 1, no other cars influenced the incident and the driver of Car 12 is fully at fault. Therefore the more lenient approach to judging Lap 1 incidents has not been applied in this case.
||
“However, they also acknowledge that the incident was not a blatant attempt to dive into the corner but rather a result of the evasive action after locking up.”
||
Speaking after his early exit from the race at the Red Bull Ring, Antonelli said: “I think I had a normal start, then going up to T3 I was just trying to maintain the position. I didn’t want to do anything because I knew there was no space in front, but then when I hit the brake I locked the rear and I got caught by that.
||
“When I locked the rear, I lost the car and then I had to first avoid the Racing Bull [of Lawson], but then I just couldn’t stop the car. Unfortunately I hit Max and I just feel very sorry towards the team, and him of course.
||
“I just apologised straight away. I recognise it’s all on me and I just feel sorry because I ended my race, but I ended his as well.”
||
Verstappen was seemingly accepting of Antonelli’s apology, the World Champion reflecting on the incident: “Unlucky, I guess. It is what it is. I spoke quickly to Kimi, he came with me to the hospitality.
||
“I think every driver has made a mistake like that. No one does that on purpose as well so for me, that’s not a big deal.”

||
While McLaren have consistently appeared to be the strongest team throughout the season, Verstappen has kept himself firmly in the battle in the Drivers' Standings, but his Championship ambitions took a major knock at the Austrian Grand Prix.
||
After showing good signs of pace in practice, he was unable to set a final flying lap in Qualifying as Pierre Gasly’s spin brought out the yellow flags, preventing the Red Bull driver from cutting down his lap time.
||
This led to him starting the race from P7, two spots ahead of Antonelli. In the expected first lap chaos, the Italian locked the rear wheels of his car and struggled to make the corner, tagging Verstappen and taking them both out of the race.
||
Asked to explain his perspective of the incident, Verstappen said: “Unlucky, I guess. It is what it is. I spoke quickly to Kimi, he came with me to the hospitality.
||
“I think every driver has made a mistake like that. No one does that on purpose as well so for me, that’s not a big deal.
||
“It was not the weekend that I guess we hoped for pace wise. Then of course we were a little bit unlucky in Qualifying with that yellow flag, otherwise you start a bit further ahead.
||
""Then the race was unlucky again. Sometimes you have those weekends.”
||
The result marked Verstappen’s first DNF since the 2024 Australian Grand Prix and meant that Red Bull scored no points at the circuit, with Yuki Tsunoda finishing last in the order – he was embroiled in a number of incidents with Franco Colapinto, earning him a 10-second time penalty when he tagged the Alpine driver into a spin.
||
Meanwhile, it was Antonelli’s third DNF of the season, and he was immediately regretful following the collision when speaking to media afterwards, with the Italian hit with a three-place grid drop for Silverstone as a result.
||
“I think I had a normal start, then going up to T3 I was just trying to maintain the position,” he said. “I didn’t want to do anything because I knew there was no space in front, but then when I hit the brake I locked the rear and I got caught by that.

||
Antonelli had been juggling his education with embarking on his debut season in Formula 1, having memorably combined the two by bringing his class from school to his first home race at Imola.
||
But now that has come to an end following the completion of his exams, with Antonelli saying of the achievement: “I'm super happy to have finished this journey, which was important to finish. Now I can just focus on racing, and it's a big relief as well.”
||
Having not been able to enjoy too many celebrations of his P3 result in Montreal given his impending examinations, the Mercedes driver admitted that balancing his school work with his racing career has proven difficult at times.
||
“I couldn't even celebrate Canada because I had to go and study straight away,” Antonelli conceded. “It's not easy of course to balance studies with motorsport, especially this year with F1 because I have a lot more commitments outside racing as well.
||
“So a lot less time but I'm super happy that I was able to finish this journey, and now I can just focus and enjoy racing.”
||
Despite this, Antonelli can still recall how it felt to stand on the podium at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, a moment that he believes marks a key “turning point” in his season.
||
“It took me a little while to realise what happened in Canada,” the 18-year-old reflected. “It was such a special moment. I remember going on the podium, I had goosebumps, especially also after hearing people chanting my name. I think was a really special moment.
||
“Also to see the whole team in the pit lane, my dad as well, I think is a memory that I will remember forever. It took me quite long because when something such as this happens, it's something so big that it takes a little bit for the brain to realise.
||
“Mercedes were so kind, they let me bring the trophy home and I put it in the living room and every day I was walking past seeing the trophy, it was special. That also made me realise what had happened.
||
“[It] was a really good result, big relief on my side and I think this has to be a turning point because obviously now I showed to myself that I can do it and now, because the feeling is so good, you just want more.”
||
Looking ahead to this weekend’s Austrian Grand Prix, Antonelli is curious to see how the pecking order shakes out.
||
“It’s going to be interesting,” the teenager said. “First of all, we need to see the weather which is quite unpredictable. Just looking at today, it was crazy.
||
“I think Canada was a good boost of confidence, was a big relief as well, especially to release the stress, and I think this weekend is going to be different.
||
“Different track, different conditions, it's a track where usually Red Bull have been strong. For sure McLaren are going to be strong so I think it's going to be pretty tight, but I'm ready to give my best.”

||
The rookie driver admitted he had struggled with the soft C6 tyre compound across the recent run of races in Europe, as he retired from both his home race in Imola and the Spanish Grand Prix, as well as crashing in Qualifying in Monaco – overall, he was unable to score a single point.

||
But the W16 seemed to be much more suited to cooler conditions in Montreal, which served the team well as George Russell found the pace to convert pole position into a race win and Antonelli secured third place just behind Max Verstappen.
||
The result was made possible by an overtake on McLaren’s Oscar Piastri on the opening lap, which saw the Italian improve from fourth to third place on track. Mercedes’ subsequent two-stop strategy helped him to maintain the position, despite some later pressure from the Australian.
||
Speaking after the race, Antonelli said: “It was so stressful but [I’m] super happy. At the start I managed to jump into P3 and I just stayed up there at the front.
||
“On the last stint I pushed a bit too hard behind Max and I killed the front left a bit. I struggled at the end but really happy to bring the podium home.”

||
When asked to elaborate on his decisive move on Piastri, he added: “I had a good first launch and I managed to get alongside. In the first corner I just tried to carry as much speed as possible.
||
“Then when I was alongside him at Turn 2 I knew I would have an advantage, especially going into Turn 3. Really happy to stick that.”
||
The soft C6 tyres that had caused Antonelli issues in Imola and Monaco were a much less popular compound at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve – the yellow-walled medium tyres looked good over a single lap, and were also the primary choice for the majority of the top 10 at lights out for the Grand Prix.
||
Mercedes’ turnaround even extended to his tyre troubles, with the 18-year-old previously explaining that driving at the track he had never competed at before had increased his confidence levels and helped him make significant progress.

Prompted on whether his next ambition will be a maiden race win, he said: “That’s the goal. Definitely this track has been good for us, the car has been incredible all weekend and hopefully we can carry the same momentum into the next few races.”

It turned out to be a tough first home race in F1 for the teenager, ending in a retirement owing to a mechanical issue, while he went on to finish Monaco down in P18 after hitting the barriers in Qualifying before recording another mechanically-related DNF in Spain.
||
Reflecting back on what he had learned across this triple header sequence ahead of this weekend’s Canadian Grand Prix, Antonelli explained: “It’s been quite a tough triple header on my side, especially because performance-wise I didn’t do that well, and then we had also a couple of issues.
||
“But overall, I think there’s still been a very big learning on my side, especially on how to manage busier weekends. Imola was incredible in terms of how busy it was and also time in front of the home crowd, and I definitely didn’t manage things the best way.

||
When pushed on what was holding him back during the last three races – given the contrast to his form earlier in the season – Antonelli responded: “I think, above all, the new C6 [tyre] – [in] Imola and Monaco – I’ve been struggling to find the consistency in the tyre, just to find the consistent performance of the tyre.
||
“The C6 seems to be a super picky tyre, and it’s really difficult to put it in the right window already from the out lap. That’s what I’ve been struggling with. In Imola, I was having such a swing of performances between sessions.
||
“In FP3 in Imola, I remember we were up there, and then in Qualifying I suddenly lost five or six tenths compared to FP3. So I’ve been really struggling to understand the tyre and to put it in the right window, and that took some confidence away.
||
“That’s why I feel in Barcelona it was nice to get back into the rhythm. But at the same time, especially at the start of the session, it took me too long to get into the rhythm. That was also because I had two really difficult Qualifying sessions in the previous two events. So definitely, I think that was the main issue.”
||

||
After not being used in Spain, the C6 tyre has returned as part of Pirelli’s selection for Montreal. Despite his previous struggles with it, Antonelli is confident that the work he has put into this will pay off at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve.
||
“During the week we had off, I spent a couple of days at the factory doing some sim work and also trying to analyse the C6 – analyse when it went well, why I was able to extract the performance, and when it went badly, what I did differently,” the 18-year-old said.
||
“I’ve been understanding quite a few things. Obviously, Montreal is a completely different track – close tarmac, a lot of low speed, and also quite cold eventually. So I’ve been trying to really work on that in order to have a better idea, so I know how to behave better, especially this weekend.”

||
After lining up in pole position, Verstappen initially led before being overtaken by McLaren’s Oscar Piastri on Lap 8 of 52.
||
While a second Safety Car phase closed the gaps again – amid changing weather conditions – the Dutchman spun shortly after the restart, dropping him down the order.
||
From there Verstappen embarked on a recovery drive and crossed the line in fifth place, while Lando Norris took victory ahead of Piastri and Kick Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg.
||
“It was just a very difficult race for us, but even after that spin I had no pace,” the four-time World Champion conceded when reflecting on his race.
||
“I was just stuck with that group and it was just very difficult to drive, and naturally of course we knew that it was going to be difficult in the wet with that [low downforce] rear wing that we had on the car.
||
“But even then I think we were still struggling a lot, and even also in the last few laps on the slick tyres were quite a handful to drive.
||
“[It was] just very difficult. A few things to look at of course, but we were no match anyway with the McLarens, and on the other hand when we have a difficult day we try to of course collect the points. To see Nico on that podium, for me at least, it’s nice to see.”
||
In terms of what the approach would be going forward – after a weekend in which a strong Qualifying performance was followed by a tougher race day – Verstappen said: “Just go to the next one.
||
“We have nothing to lose, nothing to gain – we are not in the fight for the championships, so we tried to just… see every race as a one-off and try to maximise everything.”

While Oscar Piastri had set provisional pole during the first Q3 runs, the Australian made an error during his final effort – something that Verstappen did not do as the four-time World Champion went quickest of all on a 1m 24.892s, a time 0.103s ahead of Piastri’s previous benchmark.
||
Reflecting on the lap after jumping out of the car, Verstappen admitted that the conditions had not made things easy as he explained: “It was tricky out there with the wind.
||
“Throughout the whole of Qualifying it was shifting around a bit, and around here with these cars they are extremely sensitive to it.
||
“[I] just tried to tidy it up throughout Qualifying and that final lap was good enough. This is a proper track in Qualifying, where you have to go flat-out on all these corners, you have to be really committed and that's really enjoyable.”
||
When pushed on the fact that the squad are running a car that has been trimmed on downforce – and how this appeared to benefit in Qualifying rather than just being a race choice – Verstappen responded: “We're quite quick on the straights but of course it's not that easy in the high-speed corners to manage, but we did today luckily.
||
“Of course we have to wait and see what tomorrow will do, if there's a bit of rain around or not. I'm happy of course with our Qualifying, it's a big boost for the team as well and [I’m] just excited to go racing tomorrow.”
||
Verstappen will be joined on the front row by Piastri, while the other McLaren of Lando Norris lines up just behind in third. Asked if he has the race pace to keep the papaya cars behind, the 27-year-old answered: “Difficult to say, but we'll try.

Verstappen also faced fresh questions about his future with the team on Thursday, as rumours continue to circulate the he is looking to move to Mercedes in 2026, something Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner tried to dispel in Friday's press conference.
||
""For me personally, was quite a bad day,"" said Verstappen on his Friday running. ""Just no balance in the car. Just very difficult to corner as well. Quite a poor day for us I think in general.
||
When asked how much the high and changeable wind conditions had impacted his performance, he added: ""A lot but that's of course not an excuse because everyone has to deal with that. It's not easy but same for everyone.
||
""Every weekend is a different scenario. The wind around here, it seems our car is quite sensitive to it but in general it's not been an easy day.""
||
Team mate Yuki Tsunoda endured another difficult Friday with the team and only got running in a single one-hour session, his RB21 seat having been taken by Red Bull Junior and F2 driver, Arvid Lindblad, in FP1.
||
Once back in the car for FP2, Tsunoda was only able to finish P15, half a second behind Verstappen and more than one second slower than Norris.
||
He said: ""I just had one free practice session so a couple of things I can improve in my driving and set-up. Just have to optimise it.""

['max-verstappen'],['Max Verstappen'],Horner insists Verstappen ‘would like to finish his career in a Red Bull car’ amid Mercedes rumours,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/horner-insists-verstappen-would-like-to-finish-his-career-in-a-red-bull-car.5vLQiGLH4Y68Wrv89ZE4iI,Red Bull boss Christian Horner has responded to the continued speculation surrounding Max Verstappen and a future move to Mercedes.,"Christian Horner has stated that Max Verstappen “would like to finish his career in a Red Bull car” with the team boss insisting that the squad “know where we’re at” amid continued rumours linking the Dutchman to Mercedes.
||
Verstappen had remained tight-lipped when asked about his future during Thursday’s media day, the four-time World Champion responding to questions by answering: “I have nothing to add.”
||
Horner faced similar queries when speaking to the press on Friday and, when quizzed on what Verstappen had said to him about the situation, the Red Bull Team Principal said: “There’s obviously an awful a lot of people talking about it, but what’s most important is the relationship between the driver and the team, and obviously there’s an agreement that defines that as well.
||
“Everybody’s very clear on where we’re at. Max has been with Red Bull since the very start of his career, all of his success has come in Red Bull Racing cars, and he’s been a big part of our team and he has a great deal of faith in the team and the people around him.
||
“Whilst there’s always going to be speculation and noise, I think we all sit fairly comfortable with where we’re at and what the situation is. We can’t control the narrative of others, but internally we know where we’re at.”
||
Asked if there was a plan B in place should Verstappen choose to leave, Horner joked in response, with McLaren CEO Zak Brown next to him in the press conference: “Oscar Piastri! It’s all as subjective as that. We’re very focused on our current drivers and the relationship, Max has got a contract until 2028.
||
“He’s made it quite clear that he would like to finish his career in a Red Bull car, from start to finish – I think that’s quite special and unique for him. That’s what we’re focused on, just ignoring the noise and focusing on the areas where we know we need to improve and how to do that.”
||
Horner went on to suggest that the speculation has its roots in the fact that George Russell is yet to sign a new deal with Mercedes.
||
“The contracts between the drivers and the teams are always going to remain confidential, and with any driver’s contract there is always an element of a performance mechanism and of course that exists within Max’s contract,” the Briton said.
||
“His intention is that he will be there driving for us in 2026. It’s inevitable that he’s of huge interest to any other team in the pit lane, and I think actually George probably triggered all of this speculation, probably trying to leverage his own situation and force clarity, which you can understand because he’s driven a very good season as well this year.
||
“But inevitably there will always be speculation about it. I think the most important thing is the clarity that exists between Max and the team, and that’s very clear.”
||
And in terms of whether Russell would be a realistic candidate for Red Bull if Verstappen was to leave, Horner added: “It’s remarkable that George is still on the market. We haven’t engaged in any discussion with George, so he’s obviously pretty confident that he’s going to get to retain where he is.
||
“We’ve got strength and depth within our team; you can see the Racing Bulls drivers, you can see [Arvid] Lindblad that we’re running today. And 2026 is going to be a transformational year, the biggest rule change in Formula 1 probably in the last 50 years with both chassis and power unit [changes] being introduced at the same time.
||
“Nobody with hand on heart can know what the pecking order is going to be – it could be either one of these gentleman [McLaren’s Brown and Aston Martin’s Andy Cowell] sat next to me, it could be Ferrari, it could be Mercedes, it could be anyone.
||
“I think there’s an awful lot of subjectiveness to 2026, and it will only be this time next year that you’ll have a clear indication of what that pecking order is. There are no guarantees that jumping into a Mercedes car would automatically be a better proposition.”

['max-verstappen'],['Max Verstappen'],'Nothing to add' – Verstappen remains tight-lipped as he's quizzed on Mercedes reports,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/nothing-to-add-verstappen-remains-tight-lipped-as-hes-quizzed-on-mercedes.5JRXc6zB6OTxwyCjJ365se,Red Bull's Max Verstappen remained tight-lipped about his Formula 1 future ahead of the British Grand Prix this weekend.,"Red Bull's Max Verstappen remained tight-lipped about his Formula 1 future ahead of the British Grand Prix this weekend, as he faced further questions about the possibility of joining Mercedes for 2026.
||
The four-time World Champion has been linked with a move to the Silver Arrows after George Russell said in Austria that Mercedes were having “conversations” with the Dutchman amid his own contract discussions – the Briton's current deal expires at the end of this season.
||
However, when quizzed himself on the reports at Silverstone, Russell remained confident he will race with Mercedes next season, though no confirmation was given in Thursday's press conference that a deal had been signed.
||
The ongoing saga means further speculation has built around a move for Verstappen, something the Dutchman refused to comment further on during media day ahead of the British Grand Prix.
||
""I have nothing to add,"" he said. ""What I said last week. Other people write stuff, that's great but it's not for me.""
||
He added: ""You can always say the grass is always greener on the other side, that's what they say right? I think you always have to just stay calm, enjoy also what you're doing because I think up until now I've had a lot of success and of course this season is maybe not what we wanted as a team but that can happen as well.
||
""Sometimes you just have to try and accept that as well. Other people make up more stories but that's not for me. I know what I have, I know what I can do and that's fine.""
||
Verstappen has remained part of the Red Bull family since making his F1 debut in 2015 with junior team Toro Rosso, before graduating to the senior outfit the following season.
||
After winning on his Red Bull debut in the Spanish Grand Prix, Verstappen has clinched four Drivers' titles on the bounce between 2021-2024.
||
Despite taking two wins this campaign, a retirement after being hit by Kimi Antonelli in Austria last time out means he trails championship leader Oscar Piastri by 61 points approaching the halfway point of the season.
||
While a new set of regulations for 2026 means a change in the pecking order is possible, Verstappen warned that there was no guarantee a move would place him in the quickest car on the grid.
||
""It's difficult in F1 to always be in the fastest car because then you have to look into the future,"" said Verstappen. ""Who would have known that two years ago this would be the case.
||
""That is also something I don't spend a lot of focus [on]. I think the only focus that I have at the moment is just trying to improve the situation.
||
""At the same time we are not where we want to be I think that's quite clear but at the same time, next year a lot can change again. So even if you try to chase the fastest car, it might not be the fastest car next year and that's exactly what F1 is about.""

"['max-verstappen', 'yuki-tsunoda']","['Max Verstappen', 'Yuki Tsunoda']",PALMER: Why is Verstappen the only driver able to get results for Red Bull – and what can the team do about it?,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/palmer-why-is-verstappen-the-only-driver-able-to-get-results-for-red-bull.1ErA2QRmsnRwbr4q3vhITw,"Former F1 driver Jolyon Palmer analyses what's going wrong for Yuki Tsunoda, why Max Verstappen is seemingly the only driver capable of driving the Red Bull – and the conundrum this has created for team boss Christian Horner.","Max Verstappen’s early retirement from the Austrian Grand Prix put the focus on Yuki Tsunoda’s poor form in the second Red Bull. With Max out, the rest of the Red Bull team’s sole focus was the car struggling at the opposite end of the grid. Winding up last at the end of a combative 70 laps, it was another day to forget for the Japanese racer.
||
The stark reality for Red Bull is that without Verstappen’s considerable haul of points, they would be last in the Teams’ championship.
||
After Liam Lawson’s disappointing two-race stint for the senior team, things looked temporarily better for Tsunoda at Red Bull, but he is now slumping back to a form worse than Sergio Perez and no better than Lawson’s couple of races. The truth is, without Verstappen, Red Bull aren’t even midfielders, they are tail-enders in Formula 1 and even a long way adrift of Racing Bulls.
||
It’s been well documented that the car is hard to drive, but you sensed the frustration from Christian Horner in his post Grand Prix comments – “it isn’t an easy car to drive, but it’s not that difficult either”.
||
It must have been a tough reality check for the pit wall who didn’t have their star driver in play, and who seems the only man capable of driving Red Bull’s cars over the last seven years.
||
So why is the Dutchman the only driver seemingly able to extract decent pace from the Red Bull?
||
Max has a very specific style and an incredible feel for the car. He likes a positive front end and a car that can be sharp on entry. He can also deal with the usual compromise of oversteer better than anyone in the field. The problem then seems to be finding someone else who can handle similar characteristics to Verstappen.
||
In the first races of 2025, it was clear that Lawson couldn’t drive the car consistently near the limit even around a single lap. He could do an occasional quick corner, but would then lose a heap by making a mistake at the next.
||
Trying to drive this car on the limit for an entire lap isn’t easy, unless you make changes to settle it down. But if you settle it down and find a more drivable balance, you take away the natural strength of the design philosophy and pick up too much understeer, which makes you plain slow. This seems to be where Tsunoda is at now.
||
Looking at Yuki’s Qualifying laps recently, there aren’t any obvious errors in there. He’s not hanging on to the car, or losing chunks of time in any particular corner.
||
If anything, as a driver it’s nicer to come back from a disappointing session and see that a mistake here or there cost you, because it’s something tangible. You can put your finger on it, see what you did wrong and work out how much it cost. You can also figure out changes to your driving style to correct it.
||
In Yuki’s case at the moment, there aren’t any obvious errors to point at, which is why both he and the team are left bamboozled at his lack of pace. His crash at the start of Imola Qualifying (see the clip below) looked like a case of a driver trying to reset heading into a crucial session after a difficult run of practices. He’d looked through the data and was determined to attack from the first lap.
||
Unfortunately in attacking he tried to do the impossible, lumped over the kerbs at high speed and was pitched into his dramatic crash. The car is so difficult to drive that in desperation for performance, it’s easy to over-drive and crash. But the alternative is then what happened in Barcelona and Austria – to under-drive, or have the car be too sedate and be slow.
||
Tsunoda has said he’ll delve into the data with his engineers and try to understand what is going on, but history says it’s not going to be easy to fix. After all, this is an issue that has impacted multiple drivers in multiple Red Bull cars over multiple sets of regulations.
||
When asked if he was confident about his chances at Red Bull, Yuki was bullish at the start of the season, but now nine races into his tenure in the sport’s toughest seat, I think the understanding of the fates of many before him has hit.
||
He hoped that because his driving style was closer to that of Max he would be better off, but it turns out that nobody can drive a car similar to how Max can operate at his peak.
||
I’ve never known one driver to drive so differently to so many others, but it is the only explanation and it is a complete head scratcher for Red Bull – and anyone else who might want to hire the most formidable talent in the field.
||
It is that same incredible natural style and feel that makes Max the talent he is, but in developing a car in a way that optimises their star driver, will that make any team with Max in it naturally a one-car team?
||
And what about Red Bull? Logic would say they should focus their development on making the car more drivable for the ‘average’ F1 driver, rather than their superstar, but is that just shackling their greatest asset?
||
Yuki finds himself in a tough spot. The only thing he can do is dust himself off and go again, trying another reset at Silverstone this weekend. Unlike Lawson, he has the benefit of a few years’ worth of CV to fall back on, so we know what he is capable of in the right machinery.
||
The question is, can he extract anything more out of the second half of the season in Red Bull colours and finally find a flow, or will he end up heading the way of his increasingly long line of predecessors – Alex Albon, Pierre Gasly and so on – and perhaps needing to rebuild a life outside of Red Bull at the end of the year.

||
Max Verstappen completed only two corners at the Red Bull Ring before being taken out of the action by Mercedes rival Kimi Antonelli, who misjudged his approach to Turn 3 and subsequently earned a three-place grid penalty for Silverstone.
||
Yuki Tsunoda, meanwhile, was the final finisher in 16th position, having struggled to make an impression after his Q1 exit and been given a 10-second penalty for tipping Franco Colapinto’s Alpine into a spin exiting Turn 4.
||
The result means Red Bull fall even further behind their rivals in the Teams’ Championship, holding 162 points to McLaren’s 417, while Verstappen is 61 adrift of Oscar Piastri in the Drivers’ standings.
||
“A frustrating day,” Red Bull team boss Horner summed up on F1 TV’s post-race show. “Starting with Max, he had a great start and was well-positioned for Turn 1. At Turn 3 unfortunately Kimi just lost control and wiped him out. Very frustrating… Obviously Kimi’s apologised. It is what it is.
||
“I think when you look at the pace, we wouldn’t have fought the McLarens today, but we’d have fought the Ferraris hard, for sure. George [Russell] had no pace. It was frustrating.
||
“With Yuki, it’s difficult to make progress starting where he did on the grid, then picking up a penalty as well with Colapinto. A horrible race for him today as well. Frustrating, but we’ll move on quickly to Silverstone.”
||
With that in mind, Horner was asked how Red Bull can “remedy” the struggles several drivers have now faced in the seat alongside Verstappen – and ensure that both cars are in a position to score points moving forward.
||
“We need to understand with Yuki what’s gone wrong [this weekend],” he continued. “FP1 and FP2, certainly FP2 and FP3, he was looking okay. Qualifying it seemed to fall apart for him.
||
“When you’re out of position, you’re down the pack like that, when it’s so tight… he’s struggling, I think he’s struggling for confidence. But we’ll work with him, we’ll try and help him through it.
||
“The car is… it’s a car that’s evolved over the years around the development path that we’ve taken. It isn’t an easy car to drive, but it’s not that difficult either. We’ll work with him and hopefully it’ll make a step up in Silverstone.”
||
Given the significant gaps that have developed in both championships, Horner knows Verstappen and Red Bull now face a tall order to add to their recent title successes in 2025.
||
“Well, look, the championship we’re not even thinking about,” he conceded. “We’re just focused on each race now. They’re [McLaren] a long way out of touch. We’ll just take things race by race.
||
Verstappen has won the last four Drivers’ titles on the bounce, while Red Bull were crowned Teams’ champions in 2022 and 2023 before being overhauled by McLaren last season.

||
Although he wasn’t quite able to take the top spot across practice, the Dutchman was firmly in the top three heading into Qualifying, and any error by McLaren could have seen him claim his fifth pole position at the circuit.
||
This failed to materialise, but instead of remaining in the usual top three behind the papaya frontrunners, Verstappen dropped back in the order to P7 as his final flying lap had to be aborted due to yellow flags brought out for a spin by Pierre Gasly.
||
The result is his joint worst Qualifying of the season and leaves polesitter Lando Norris and third-placed Oscar Piastri with the perfect opportunity to further extend their lead over Verstappen in the Drivers' Standings.
||
He earlier described the Red Bull as “nervous” and “snappy” in FP3, but these problems seemed to worsen as Qualifying went on.
||
“Everything fell apart a bit,” he said afterwards. “Every corner was a bit of a struggle to be honest. No balance, no front, no rear in different places of the corner, so that made it very difficult to get in a rhythm and a bit of a benchmark.
||
“Even with the final lap, of course I had a yellow so I had to abort. It was still not even close to pole so that was quite a painful Qualifying for us.”
||
Asked whether the car’s race pace indicated any room for improvement in the Grand Prix, he responded: “Yeah but tomorrow’s probably going to be even warmer than today.
||
""It seems like as soon as it got warmer, it made our struggles even worse. That doesn’t look great, but we’ll see tomorrow. Maybe [there will be] some surprises in the race.”
||
Overall, it was a session to quickly forget for Red Bull as Tsunoda experienced a similar phenomenon to his team mate. After claiming P7 and P9 in FP2 and FP3 respectively, he was knocked out in Q1 despite being just over two-tenths adrift of Verstappen up in P7.
||
With remarkably close margins separating the entire field, the Japanese driver ended up in P18, later reporting issues with the balance just like Verstappen.
||
Prompted to explain exactly what went wrong, Tsunoda replied: “I don’t know, I’ll have to check but the balance was completely off on the last lap. I felt quite good on the first push but the second push was somehow completely off.
||
“I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong with the warm up or anything. To be honest, the balance was completely different so it’s hard to explain that.
||
“Even if the pace is good, ending up like this is so frustrating. The balance in the end just meant I couldn’t put together a time. I have to talk with the engineers.”

||
As he hit the Red Bull Ring for his initial laps of Free Practice 1, Verstappen reported some issues with the RB21 over the radio – but this time, rather than speaking to ‘GP’, the World Champion was instead talking with Simon Rennie, who is standing in for Lambiase for the event while the Italian-British engineer steps aside for personal reasons.
||
Lambiase is set to return at the British Grand Prix but, in the interim, Verstappen has spoken positively about his first day of working directly with Rennie, who has previously acted as a race engineer for drivers including Mark Webber, Daniel Ricciardo and Alex Albon since joining Red Bull in 2013.
||
When pushed on how different it had felt without GP – with it being put to him that they have a special relationship, having worked together since Verstappen arrived at the team in 2016 – Verstappen answered: “Yeah, for sure, but that’s how it is now.
||
“I think so far today’s been really good with Simon, of course I’ve known Simon for a long time on the other side of the garage and working with him also in the simulator. He has a lot of experience, so it’s been actually very good today. He was straight on it and it was nice.”
||
In terms of how the day went out on track – with Verstappen ending FP1 in second place on the timesheets before setting the third fastest time in FP2 – the 27-year-old reflected: “I think overall it was quite straightforward.
||
“Didn’t have any big issues, but just lacking a bit of pace, a bit too much understeer in the car as well [in the] short run and long run, so that is something that we have to try and get rid of.”
||
On the other side of the garage, it looked to be a day of progress for Yuki Tsunoda, who went from being P17 on the board in first practice to P7 during Friday’s second practice hour.
||
“I think it went in the right direction from FP1 for FP2,” the Japanese driver conceded after jumping out of the car. “We’re still missing bits, or maybe more, but at least I’ve found a couple of positives so we’ll look for more.”
||
Since his promotion from Racing Bulls at Round 3 in Japan, Tsunoda has been in the process of adapting to the RB21.
||
Pushed on whether he feels that his confidence in the car has been building so far this weekend, the 25-year-old responded: “Yeah, definitely. This kind of track, attacking through high-speed, you need confidence.
||
“With that, I think confidence in FP2 felt much better – that’s all I need anyway. I’m still learning about this car and you need a good build-up, so so far I’m happy with this kind of approach – [I] just have to put it all together more tomorrow.”

||
Also known simply as ‘GP’, Lambiase has worked with Verstappen since the Dutchman stepped up from Toro Rosso to Red Bull Racing in the early stages of the 2016 season – their partnership starting with a spectacular victory at the Spanish Grand Prix.
||
Plenty more trophies have been achieved together over the years, including 65 Grand Prix wins and four world titles – Verstappen now pushing for what would be a record-equalling fifth successive championship crown.
||
However, Verstappen is preparing to navigate a race weekend at Red Bull without Lambiase next to him for the very first time, as the Italian-British engineer steps aside for personal reasons. He is set to return at the British Grand Prix.
||
In Lambiase’s place comes Simon Rennie, an experienced Red Bull employee who previously served as a race engineer and is currently Group Leader of Simulation Engineering at the team.
||
Born in North Yorkshire, England, Rennie started his F1 career with Renault in the mid-2000s, working as a Data Engineer for Fernando Alonso during the Spaniard’s breakthrough 2005 and 2006 title-winning seasons.
||
Rennie remained at Renault (later rebranded as Lotus) for several years, gaining promotion to race engineer when Alonso returned from McLaren, while also assisting the likes of Heikki Kovalainen, Robert Kubica, Nick Heidfeld and Kimi Raikkonen.
||
During the 2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, which Raikkonen won, a radio exchange between the Finn and Rennie went viral. Informed by Rennie of the gap to the cars behind him, Raikkonen bluntly replied: “Just leave me alone, I know what to do!”
||
For the 2013 campaign, Rennie made the switch from Renault to reigning Drivers’ and Constructors’ champions Red Bull, taking over as Mark Webber’s race engineer.
||
Webber’s retirement later that year led to Rennie working with promoted junior driver Daniel Ricciardo – their partnership spanning five seasons and yielding several race wins.
||
Rennie decided to take a non-travelling role ahead of the 2019 season, with Ricciardo subsequently leaving long-time backers Red Bull for a new chapter at Renault.
||
After a year in the factory, Rennie returned as Alex Albon’s race engineer in 2020, but he stepped aside again for 2021 when the Thai-British driver got replaced by Sergio Perez.
||
Rennie has since been working away in the background at Red Bull’s Milton Keynes base, heading up their Simulation Engineering operations to aid the team remotely.
||
He will be back in the spotlight again this weekend, though, as the 45-year-old replaces Lambiase at the Red Bull Ring and attempts to guide Verstappen to more glory.

||
Vettel has a deep, successful connection with Red Bull, earning the team’s first F1 pole position and race win back in 2009, and becoming their maiden World Champion a year later – kicking off a run of four straight title-winning seasons.
||
He left the Milton Keynes-based squad at the end of the 2014 campaign, completing stints at Ferrari and Aston Martin, before retiring from the sport at the end of 2022 with 53 victories, 122 podium finish and 57 poles to his name.
||
Now, the 37-year-old has openly admitted to conversations with long-time Red Bull junior chief Marko, 82, about the possibility of stepping into the Austrian’s shoes when he decides to step away from F1.
||
Speaking in an appearance on ORF TV’s Sport am Sonntag podcast, Vettel explained: “There have been a few headlines recently. I still get along great with Helmut, and we’re in contact regarding the topic.”
||
He added: “[Talks are] not yet that intensive or in-depth, it’s perhaps something that could play a role. In what form remains to be seen.”
||
Quizzed about those comments ahead of this weekend’s Austrian Grand Prix, fellow four-time World Champion Verstappen gave his seal of approval to such a scenario – should Vettel ultimately decide to go down that route.
||
“I mean, it’s more than normal that someone that has achieved so much with Red Bull, has been brought up by Red Bull, that… in a sense there’s always a spot available, right?” Verstappen said.
||
“I think also Seb always kept a really good relationship with Helmut anyway, even when he left. I’m sure that there’s always a space for Seb, in any kind of form.”
||
Since vacating a race seat, Vettel has maintained an F1 paddock presence in various ways, including sustainability initiatives, tributes to Ayrton Senna that he organised in Imola and Sao Paulo last year, and a recent karting-based Race4Women event in Saudi Arabia.

||
There had been much made of the two rivals from Barcelona sharing the front row in Canada, with Russell joking after Qualifying that he had more Super Licence penalty points to play with if any wheel-to-wheel racing occurred on the first lap.
||
But in the end both kept that opening lap clean, and from there Verstappen did not put a foot wrong as he kept Russell honest ahead, whilst defending from Kimi Antonelli behind.
||
While Verstappen remains on 11 penalty points and just one point away from a race ban, two of those points come off after the next race in Austria – giving the Dutchman some breathing room moving forward.

“I think that it's inevitable that there was going to be some potential gamesmanship,” Horner explained afterwards.

“It's something that we raised after the drivers’ briefing, you know, with the Race Director. Just so that they were mindful of it as well. Because it's clear that, you know, that kind of stuff goes on.
||
“But Max, I thought he's been squeaky clean all weekend. He drove a very good race today.”
||
Verstappen ran an aggressive strategy that saw him pit early to try and undercut Russell, but to no avail. Even so, Red Bull had the pace to beat the McLarens and Ferraris, with Verstappen able to score his fifth podium of the season.
||
“I think it was a solid race for us. I mean, the first thing, we pushed pretty hard early on, on the medium tyre. The tyre then started to open up. So, I would say the second stint for us was probably our least competitive stint,"" continued Horner.
||
“We started to open up and grain the front left. But then the last stint was very strong and was actually better than Kimi's behind, and was pretty much a match to George ahead on five or six-lap [younger] tyres.
||
“I think it was a very solid race for us. Good points today. It was a well-executed race from that perspective.”
||
Red Bull did protest Russell’s finishing result, questioning his driving behind the late Safety Car – but Horner was keen to stress that was a team decision, and did not come from Verstappen. It is the second time in five races Red Bull have questioned Russell's antics.
||
“It's certainly not personal to George... The way the regulations are, the regulations are pretty binary, pretty clear.
||
“So, we've put in a protest. Regulations are very clear about the Safety Car. If you remember Checo [Sergio Perez] back in Singapore in '22 got two penalties for it.”
||
The stewards found no case to answer in the end, but second place was still enough for Verstappen to close the gap on Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris in the Championship, with the former coming home fourth and the latter failing to finish following a clash with his team mate.
||
Verstappen now sits on 155 points in the Championship, 21 behind Norris and 43 behind Piastri.

||
With the McLaren pair of Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris starting from third and sixth place on the grid, the day offered a good opportunity for the Dutchman to marginally close the gap to his rivals in the drivers’ standings, especially as he qualified on the front row.
||
However, he found that overtaking polesitter and eventual winner George Russell was unattainable both at lights out and throughout the race, although he was rarely more than a few seconds behind the Mercedes driver.
||
Kimi Antonelli was too far back to challenge for P2 in the latter stages, and the unexpected collision between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri secured Verstappen’s first podium since Imola as the race ended under Safety Car conditions.
||
“It was quite a good race even though I think the first two stints we were struggling quite a bit on the tyres, so we were doing quite an aggressive strategy,” Verstappen summarised post-race.
||
“Luckily in that final stint we managed to hang in there and actually the pace was a bit better, a lower fuel load so that was good.
||
“I think we drove an attacking/defending race – attacking with the strategy, defending of course with the cars behind. It worked out for us and I think that was the maximum possible for us today.”
||
It was a weekend of highs and lows for the reigning champion as the subject of his clash with Russell in Spain still lingered, although he started strong by topping the timesheets in first practice ahead of Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz.
||
Things went downhill as the sessions continued and Red Bull adjusted their set-up, but he was happy to claim a spot on the front row despite missing out on pole position by 0.160s.
||
Asked to look at the wider championship and Red Bull's upcoming home race in Austria, Verstappen replied: “It’s a long season so you need to go race by race. We’ll always do the best we can.
||
“It’s always a great weekend [in Austria]. We’ve had a lot of great results and hopefully we can have another strong weekend there.”

With the pair starting together on the front row, Verstappen was asked whether the layout of Turns 1/2 would benefit the driver starting in second despite the short run to the opening corners.

FP2: Russell narrowly leads Norris and Antonelli in Canada after Stroll strikes the wall

||
Some of the attention coming into the weekend still lingered on Verstappen’s reaction and penalty for his collision with the Briton in Spain, with Team Principal Christian Horner revealing that the driver issued an apology to the team during their post-race debrief.
||
But the cooler conditions that Canada offers have thrown up other difficulties for Red Bull as Verstappen lamented over the radio: “When the brakes are cold, it doesn’t bite – it’s worse than FP1”. Like many others, he struggled to find the necessary grip and was seen cutting the final chicane numerous times during FP2.
||
“The day was alright to be honest,” he said. “I felt quite happy with the car. FP2 was a bit more difficult for other reasons – I think we lost something with the car balance-wise that we need to investigate, but overall I think it was quite a positive day for us.
||
“If we can get it back to how it felt in FP1, I think we look quite okay. Let’s see tomorrow – there’s still one more session where people can get it right. For us, we just want to get it in a good window and then we’ll see how far we are up there in Qualifying.”

HIGHLIGHTS: Catch the action as Russell tops second practice in Canada

In contrast to previous rounds, there was no clear team out at the front following the first two practice sessions – drivers from Mercedes, Red Bull, McLaren and Williams all broke into the top three without establishing an obvious favourite for Qualifying.
||
While Verstappen seemed assured that they could still be in the fight for the higher positions, Tsunoda held the more low-key ambition of progressing to the final stage of Qualifying, a feat he has not achieved since the Miami Grand Prix.
||
As the track evolved, everyone’s lap times improved between FP1 and FP2, but the Japanese driver dropped back from P11 to P15 with a 0.273s deficit to his team mate in the latter session.
||
However, he hinted at a potential change to the car that will be implemented for the remainder of the weekend and hopefully help him return to the top 10.

Tsunoda showed some much-needed promise during Qualifying at Silverstone, with the Japanese driver pushing for a Q3 spot until a power issue hampered his final run and left him just outside the cut.
||
Starting the race from 11th, Tsunoda was hopeful of being in points contention amid the changeable weather, only to struggle throughout and eventually cross the line as the final finisher – a lap down on winner Lando Norris.
||
Tsunoda’s afternoon included a clash with Haas rookie Ollie Bearman, which earned him a 10-second penalty and added insult to injury.
||
“I mean, it’s quite clear with that collision,” he said afterwards. “Other than that, to be honest the pace was sadly very slow.

“When it comes to the long run, it’s something that always is very outstandingly slow somehow. Just ‘degging’ [the tyres] like crazy – I never had like this kind of feeling.

“I know we were running quite low downforce, but to be honest I had still good confidence in the rain. The rain pace was absolutely nowhere, so I’m a bit lost.”

Asked what he can take from the weekend, given his apparent progress before the race, Tsunoda added: “Yeah, a couple of positives from the dry conditions. On one lap it was pretty good, but yeah, the long run is something to look at more.”

||
A tough Saturday at Spielberg saw Tsunoda exit Qualifying in Q1, resulting in the Japanese driver lining up in P18 on the grid. The troubles continued on Sunday, with Tsunoda picking up a 10-second time penalty following a collision with Alpine’s Franco Colapinto before ending the race down in 16th and last place.
||
Pushed on whether he understood the issues that affected him at the Red Bull Ring ahead of the weekend’s upcoming British Grand Prix, Tsunoda took the blame for his tough outing as he explained: “The issue in the race was me.
||
“Trying to overtake [Colapinto], I could have just waited one more lap probably. It was a bit unnecessary to push flat out that much in that situation. The race craft wasn’t ideal from myself. The pace itself after that, [having] changed the front wing and everything, it’s not really probably the best reference I’ll get.
||
“But it’s still the session I’m working on really hard so far, especially the long run is the stint I’m normally struggling at. We worked so hard the last couple of days coming into here, what we can do better or not, and we’ve got to try a couple of [things].
||
“I’m looking forward to it, I’m feeling strong, and I think in the short run hopefully it will come soon in terms of the confidence that level I want.”
||
When quizzed on whether he still feels full support from the Red Bull team, Tsunoda responded: “Definitely, yeah. I feel support more than ever, from Christian and Helmut. I went to the south of the UK with a physio in Red Bull Racing to kind of reset myself, and that was coming from them.
||
“They just wanted [me] to have the fresh air and everything, so that helps a lot for me to build up in a way with my rhythm, and also we’re going to try a couple of things.”
||
Tsunoda acknowledged that having Marko’s support – amid the advisor recently suggesting that another driver change is not immediately on the cards at Red Bull – is helpful going forward.
||
“Yes, rather than him saying I’m going to switch in two races or whatever!” the 25-year-old joked. “Yeah, for sure. Him and Christian are very supportive. He was obviously not happy with my race in Austria, but at the same time he’s still willing to continuously help and support me.
||
“He still trusts my talent and the speed, I just have to prove at the track that I can do it. Helmut is just a direct guy, some races if [I] do bad he’ll tell me what was wrong or what was right.
||
“It’s the kind of pressure that he gives me, to really be at the level that I never think about or extract from me some performance. It’s just the way that he works from when I was a junior, and I appreciate from how much support I’m getting.”
||
Tsunoda is not the first driver to struggle to match Max Verstappen’s performance in the Red Bull and, when asked if he believes that it can take almost a full season or longer for anyone other than Verstappen to adapt to the car, the Japanese racer said: “I don’t know, it depends on the driver.
||
“I didn’t see yet a driver that got used to it in that car straight away, so that’s probably a fact but at the same time I feel I’m in the right direction, at least in the short run. I missed out in Q1 in Austria, but at the same time the gap was pretty small.
||
“Also in terms of the whole package, I know there is something to come as well into this year compared to Max. Once I get the full package, I still have good confidence that I can be in the level that they want, and also that’s what I’m working hard on.
||
“In terms of long run, it’s exactly the place that I’m still probably struggling at, but I’ll find a way. I saw a couple of driving styles I can try, that I never tried in my career in Formula 1, so it’s just learning stuff.”

||
Qualifying had already proven tough for Tsunoda, who exited in Q1 after only managing to secure P18 on the grid. From there he faced a tricky afternoon at the Red Bull Ring, during which he received a 10-second time penalty – along with two penalty points – for causing a collision with Alpine’s Franco Colapinto.
||
While the Japanese driver avoided any further punishments when he was investigated for allegedly forcing Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll off the track in another battle, he was unable to make much progress through the field and crossed the line down in P16.
||
Reflecting on his race after jumping out of the car, Tsunoda – who has finished outside of the points for the last four Grands Prix – was left searching for answers over how he can improve.
||
“To be honest the move on Franco was a bit unnecessary,” the 25-year-old said. “I could probably wait one more lap, but that was a pretty bad move for myself.
||
“Otherwise the pace itself was pretty poor as well – not sure what I’m doing wrong, to be honest. I have to look through harder, but to be honest it’s really, really hard to find the reason for what I’m doing so wrong to drive this slow.”
||
With the British Grand Prix just a few days away as the second stop of a double header of races, Tsunoda was quizzed on whether he would use the limited time before that event to try to understand the car further, or if he would instead take more of a break following a tough weekend.
||
“I will look through more,” the Red Bull driver explained. “I just have to investigate more, and if I can do something different in driving style or if I can take something that Max [Verstappen] is doing differently compared to myself, whatever it is, I’ll try, from left to right, everything, and keep improving.”
||
It was a difficult day all-round for the Milton Keynes-based outfit, with Verstappen out of the running on Lap 1 following a collision with Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli, for which the Italian received a three-place grid penalty for next weekend’s race at Silverstone.

||
Tsunoda’s prospects for race day took a hit on Saturday when he was handed a 10-place grid penalty for overtaking McLaren’s Oscar Piastri under red flag conditions in Free Practice 3, meaning that – after qualifying in 11th – he would start from the back of the field.
||
The 25-year-old ran a long opening stint on the hard tyre before switching to the mediums – and while he made gains from his original starting slot, Tsunoda ultimately ended the race in P12, meaning that he has gone without points for the last three races.
||
Asked if the result had been the maximum that was possible from where he started – particularly given the traffic that he faced at times – Tsunoda conceded: “Yeah, pretty much, that’s it.
||
“The pace was okay, not amazing but still not too bad. Other than that, pretty much that’s it really. At least [a] positive is the car performance now, and the pace in the car felt a bit more normal or better than last previous races, so at least there’s a bit of motivation there.”
||
Since moving to Red Bull from Racing Bulls at the third race weekend of the season in Japan – as part of a driver swap with Liam Lawson – Tsunoda has been open about the challenge of getting to grips with the RB21, having at one point compared it to “a science room”.
||
While there have been positive moments during this process – with points coming in Bahrain, Miami and Imola – Tsunoda acknowledged in Montreal that it also brings pressure, though admitted that he hopes to use this as an opportunity to prove himself.
||
“[Saturday] was a tough day with the 10-place nonsense penalty,” the Red Bull driver said. “[I] lost a lot of time in FP3, especially with the new upgrades when you want to especially learn about the car.
||
“Still with our team, you want to be as high as possible, but I enjoy this challenge I guess. [In] these moments I’m having a lot of pressure, sometimes I’m not enjoying them that much but it’s part of the time that [is] an opportunity to improve myself and prove myself more.”

Tsunoda will be hoping for better when F1 heads to the Red Bull Ring for his team’s home event, the Austrian Grand Prix, on June 27-29.

Piastri had caused the stoppage after hitting the Wall of Champions, which damaged the right-rear tyre as debris was strewn across the track on his way back to the pits.
||
Tsunoda came across the damaged McLaren on the back straight and passed Piastri, but was summoned to the stewards after the session for his actions.
||
Despite acknowledging that Tsunoda had been wary of being hit by debris, the stewards deemed ""there was no justifiable reason"" for the Japanese driver to overtake and handed him the same penalty given to Haas’ Ollie Bearman for the same offence in Monaco.
||
""The 10-place grid penalty came out of nowhere to be honest, I didn't even expect to be summoned for that,"" said Tsunoda following Qualifying in Montreal, where his P11 finish will see him start the Grand Prix at the back of the grid.

""I don't know what they wanted me to do. Oscar had massive damage in the last corner, I saw him in the back straight driving 80kph, very slow. He was spraying debris everywhere and I saw even the tyre was going sideways so I thought if I keep driving behind, at one point the tyre is going to come off and hit me. You want to avoid that and it's a very unnecessary situation.

""But apparently that's not allowed, apparently they expect me to sit behind a car and wait to get hit. I don't think I deserve this penalty because debris was all over the place, not just the last corner. I don't know what they want me to do to be honest. It's frustrating.""
||
Now facing a back-of-the-grid start for the Canadian Grand Prix, Tsunoda explained he still needed time to feel confident in his Red Bull machine.

""Obviously I'm not happy with P11. I think the balance was pretty good, the team did a fantastic job to support me in those areas but I just need time, especially having that issue in FP3 didn't help much.""

While FP3 was able to resume soon afterwards, Tsunoda was noted for allegedly overtaking Piastri when the red flag was out, and it was soon confirmed that the incident would be investigated after the session.

||
The troubles started early on in the weekend at the Red Bull Ring for Sainz, the Spaniard citing floor damage and brake problems after his Q1 exit in Qualifying that put him down in P19 on the grid.
||
Come race day, Sainz had made his way to the grid but was unable to pull away when the formation lap got underway, having reported that his car was “stuck in first gear”. Despite eventually getting going, the Williams was ultimately unable to take the start after returning to the pit lane.
||
Asked if he was surprised at what had happened, Sainz responded: “Yeah, very disappointed obviously to come to Austria and not be able to race, after even so many issues yesterday in Quali and this issue today.
||
“[We’re] going through a bit of a bad run with a lot of issues as a team so, in a short period of time before our home Grand Prix, we need to regroup and see what we can do better.”
||
While the Grove-based outfit have endured a tougher run of late – despite still holding fifth place in the Teams’ standings – Sainz is hopeful that their fortunes can be reversed in the near future.
||
“It’s racing, it’s part of the sport,” the 30-year-old said of Williams’ recent bad luck. “Also as an athlete you always go through luckier times, unluckier times, better times, difficult times.
||
“The sport has taught me that this can change very quickly. I just need to keep working hard, keep my head down and things will change. But as a team for sure we need to look at many things, regroup and see how we can stop having so many issues.”
||
The team’s afternoon at the Red Bull Ring took a further hit when Albon was forced to retire after 15 laps. Speaking after jumping out of the car, the Thai driver admitted that he did not yet know the root cause but suggested that there were similarities to his previous DNF last time out in Montreal.
||
“It felt inside the cockpit a bit like Canada,” Albon explained. “We need to review it, we seem to be struggling a little bit with… I’m not sure if it’s temperature-related, but we’ve had a few DNFs now in a row so it’s a bit annoying, especially when we’re in the fight for points.”
||
With this marking his third consecutive retirement, the 29-year-old acknowledged that Williams need to quickly address the problems.
||
“Frustrating, honestly it’s frustrating,” Albon said in his summary of how he was feeling about another DNF.
||
“I think in the last two races before we were maybe not always there for points – today we clearly were, and so it hurts a bit more today. We just need to make sure we stop it, because it’s hampering our mid part of the season quite a lot.”

||
Sainz, who also fell at the first Qualifying hurdle in Spain and Canada, struggled to make an impact when Saturday’s grid-deciding session got under way at the Red Bull Ring.
||
Having wound up 19th, ahead of only Kick Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg, the Spaniard expressed major concerns to his engineer over the radio as he returned to the pit lane.
||
“There’s damage in the car, for sure,” Sainz reported. “The car is undriveable. When I say undriveable, it’s pulling under braking, no load in high-speed. Undriveable.”
||
When he arrived in the media pen to speak to the world’s television broadcasters, Sainz confirmed that Williams had subsequently spotted car damage – as well as other costly issues.
||
“We’ve just seen that we had quite a bit of damage on the floor, so we were lacking quite a lot of downforce,” he said. “We also had an issue with the brakes from the start of Quali, so too many things going to on to actually push around a high-confidence track like this.”
||
Asked about what might be possible in the race, Sainz added: “[It’s been] a very weird weekend. We’ve been very quick in the long runs with the harder tyres, and then on soft tyres we never seem to be competitive. We’ll have to have a look why.”
||
It was a more encouraging session for Sainz’s team mate, Alex Albon, who caught the eye in Q1 and went on to qualify 12th – albeit with car damage also impacting his efforts.
||
“Honestly, I’m really happy,” he said, despite just missing out on Q3. “We damaged the floor in Q1 in the middle of my quick lap.
||
""I ran wide through Turn 7 and we were fixing the rear with tape. Then we had that red flag, which was maybe the worst-timed red flag that could be there.
||
“We ended up doing our last Q2 lap on used tyres and a damaged floor and we managed 12th, so I’m really happy.”
||
Previewing Sunday’s action, the Thai-British racer commented: “We actually had good race pace [in practice]. I think, honestly, most probably in line with where we qualified, maybe a little bit faster than that still.
||
“We’ve got some good tyre options, I think we saved a couple more mediums than other teams, so let’s see how it goes.”
||
Williams head into the race holding a comfortable fifth position in the Teams’ Championship standings on 55 points, 27 clear of Haas and Racing Bulls.

||
Vowles has held the position since the start of the 2023 season, having moved across from Mercedes where he spent four years as Motorsport Strategy Director and with now more than two decades of experience in the sport.
||
Under Vowles' leadership, the illustrious team has gone from struggling at the back of the field to fighting consistently for point-scoring finishes, with Williams currently fifth in the Teams' Championship.
||
With an upturn in form, the decision was made ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix this weekend to extend Vowles' involvement with the team as he looks to take them back to the top and add to the nine Constructors' and seven Drivers' titles already achieved.
||
""I feel at home here. This feels like it was made to be and we gel really well,"" Vowles told Sky Sports F1.
||
""I'm so incredibly fortunate with Dorilton and our board, we talk, today we've spoken twice already. It's not a normal board in that regard, we're very interactive and close.
||
""The first few years are really making sure each other is the right fit for this in the long-term. We've now, I think, shown the world we can do some basics right, which is where we're at now.
||
""Now it's to properly build this into a championship-winning team and that will take some time and this commitment to each other is a serious commitment towards that goal. I couldn't be happier.
||
""This Williams feels like, if this is where I spend the remainder of my career, it would have been a very good and well spent amount of time.""
||
Alex Albon praised Vowles' input at the team, having been with Williams since 2022 and since a gradual improvement in performance, which includes scoring points in seven of the 10 Grands Prix so far this year.
||
“I think it's a great vote of confidence for all of us,"" he said.
||
“I feel like James has clearly spearheaded the team in a good direction, the right direction, and for myself, the team, it's a great sign of things to come and shows trust and confidence from the board. It makes the future brighter for the team.”

||
It was confirmed in the days after the Canadian Grand Prix that Vowles – who first joined the squad from Mercedes at the start of 2023 – had agreed a new long-term deal, meaning that he will remain in charge as the squad continue their mission of returning to winning ways.
||
When asked ahead of this weekend’s race in Austria about the importance of Vowles’ new contract, Albon responded: “I think it's a great vote of confidence for all of us.
||
“I feel like James has clearly spearheaded the team in a good direction, the right direction, and for myself, the team, it's a great sign of things to come and shows trust and confidence from the board. It makes the future brighter for the team.”
||
Albon went on to praise Vowles’ leadership skills as he reflected on how the Briton has most greatly impacted the team since his arrival.
||
“I would say the biggest impact is that he is direct, he's honest and he's very simply just a good leader,” Albon conceded. “He tells us the direction and we follow.”
||
Upon joining Williams in 2023, Vowles set his focus on transforming the team’s fortunes – and things definitely look to have improved in recent times, with the 2025 campaign marking the outfit’s strongest start to a season since 2016.
||
Currently sitting fifth in the Teams’ Championship, the 55 points achieved collectively by Albon and Carlos Sainz so far is more than the number of points the squad scored across the previous three seasons combined.
||
Pushed on whether there might be the chance for a podium during this campaign, Albon said: “We have a better chance than previous years, if the time ever comes to get a podium.
||
“I don't think we can get a podium on pure pace, but it does feel like the podium chances often happen to the top midfield team of that weekend, and we're in that position quite often.
||
“There haven’t been many crazy races this year where it's been wet-dry-wet-dry, I think maybe Australia and Miami. I wouldn't say I expect a podium this year but, if it happens, it happens.”
||
For now the focus is on the weekend ahead at the Red Bull Ring, a circuit that Albon is “optimistic” about in terms of whether it might suit the FW47.
||
“To be honest, Canada should have suited us too and it looked like it was, we just fell a bit short come Saturday and Sunday,” the 29-year-old conceded.
||
“The vibes are still strong. I think this weekend does suit our car,
Silverstone more so, but we're seeing now the other teams with their upgrades – they're definitely catching up.”

||
While they later explained that this was perhaps down to running an alternative programme to others, the team remained in the mix during the second practice hour, a session in which Albon set the fourth fastest time while Sainz was not far behind in seventh.
||
Asked after jumping out of the car if the day had been a positive one for Williams, Albon responded: “Yeah, very positive. We hit the ground running, I think we were maybe running a different programme to everyone else in FP1 at least, so maybe flattered ourselves with it.
||
“But FP2, [we were] feeling okay. I think we struggled a little bit with the brakes throughout today, so we lost a little bit of confidence and rhythm which around here is very important. But the base car is strong, I think we have a good package underneath us. I think Q3 is within our targets for tomorrow.”
||
Despite this, the Thai driver admitted that there are still some areas for improvement for the team.
||
HIGHLIGHTS: Catch the action as Russell tops second practice in Canada
||
“It’s one of those ones where the car still doesn’t feel fantastic – we still have some work to do,” he explained. “It’s good, it shows there is a bigger envelope we need to explore.
||
“It’s good because we are quick, you don’t want to change too much – there is a bit of balance between it. I don’t think we are quite there yet, and if we want to score big points we are going to have to make the car quicker.”
||
Sainz was also feeling positive about Williams’ performance at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve on Friday, the Spaniard reflecting after second practice: “[I feel] very good. This morning, we were simply just running a bit lighter or a bit more engine mode than the others, that’s why our competitiveness seemed higher than expected.
||
“On FP2 we were still in the mix, but a good step behind [George] Russell who seems very quick and some others. But [we are] more or less where we expected, three or four tenths off the fastest cars which is a good place to be going into tomorrow.”
||
Pushed on how the car felt with more fuel onboard, Sainz answered: “It was okay, still not at the level of the leading cars but out of the midfield and out of the back end of the top of the field, we seem to be in the mix again this weekend.

“So, [I’m] happy, the car gives me confidence. There is probably going to be a bit of a balance again with the tyres, whether to run C6 or C5 in Quali because they seem again extremely close. But apart from that, honestly just focusing on making sure we nail the tyre strategy for tomorrow.”
||
And in terms of taking the fight to the likes of Mercedes and Ferrari, Sainz suggested that Williams may struggle to get ahead of these teams but remains hopeful that they can be close.
||
“I think when they all turn it up, we will struggle to out-qualify them or get in the mix with them, but we are not too far, which again like in Miami and Imola is a good place to be,” the 30-year-old conceded.

||
The German had the record for the most F1 starts without scoring a rostrum, but that ended on Sunday as he put in an error-free performance in the most testing of conditions – in what was his 239th start – to rise from P19 on the grid to P3 at the flag.
||
Hulkenberg and Kick Sauber made the right calls at the right time – swapping to fresh intermediate tyres just as the rain was starting to fall again, before making those last long enough to bolt on some mediums at the end.
||
Hulkenberg also had work to do on track as he rose up the order, overtaking Lance Stroll for third and then not making any mistakes in the closing laps despite knowing Lewis Hamilton was chasing hard to get back in touch.
||
“Where do I start… The most overdue podium in F1 history and the first podium for the team since Japan in 2012,"" said Wheatley after the race.
||
""This was a weekend of highs and lows but, ultimately, we pulled it all together and when the opportunity was there, we grabbed it with both hands.”
||
“From starting in 19th to P3 this was the lowest ever starting position for a podium finisher in Sauber’s 32-year history and, after 239 Grand Prix starts, Nico delivered the goods. No driver is more deserving of a podium than Nico.”
||
Wheatley is no stranger to success in F1, moving to Kick Sauber from Red Bull to be part of the project that will ultimately see the team transform into Audi from next season.
||
And the Briton was in no doubt about the magnitude of what Hulkenberg did on Sunday, calling his efforts, amongst other things, a “masterclass.”
||
“Nico drove an outstanding race today, one of the best I've seen at Silverstone and one of the best I've seen of any driver ever,"" he said. ""It seems incredible to me that we're all celebrating a podium as it feels to me like he should have been getting them all his career.
||
“I can't speak for anyone other than myself. I've considered him to be an extraordinary talent for a very long time, and I think I've been consistent in saying that to everyone here. It seemed incredible to me that he's never achieved a podium in his career.”
||
With Hulkenberg's Silverstone achievement secured, and with the regulation change incoming for next year, as well as a chance for the pecking order to be jumbled up – can the German now go one better and win in Formula 1?
||
“I think Nico showed today what he's capable of,"" Wheatley continued. ""I think given the right race car, given the right circumstances, he's capable of delivering that. I have no doubt he can win a race.
||
“He's an outstanding driver and he just showed it today.”
||
Wheatley was also quick to pay credit to Hulkenberg’s clear and calm direction over the radio throughout a frenetic race that saw multiple crashes, spins and plenty of strategy dilemmas.
||
Gabriel Bortoleto did not make it to the flag after spinning off on the medium tyres on a wet track – but the rookie stuck around to listen to Hulkenberg’s radio throughout the race and learn from his experienced team mate.
||
“Gabriel has a tremendous work ethic, and he has a capacity for learning,"" the Sauber team boss continued. ""He wants to learn. He's drawing information out of everything.
||
“He takes information in from everywhere. I think for him to sit there in those conditions and listen to Nico asking all the right questions and conversations on the radio, it's only going to make him stronger.”

For a driver one month short of his 38th birthday, it was an incredible result – not least because it was achieved from 19th on the grid.
||
The German made his F1 debut all the way back in 2010, and his career in the sport looked to be over when he was left without a seat at the conclusion of the 2019 season.
||
But after two years on the sidelines bar a handful of ‘super sub’ appearances, Hulkenberg was handed a lifeline to return to F1 in 2022 with Haas – and since then has put in a string of strong performances.
||
You only have to look at the last handful of races, since Kick Sauber introduced an upgrade package, to see the kind of performances the German is delivering. P16 on the grid in Spain became fifth at the flag, P13 on the grid in Canada resulted in an eighth-place finish and then Hulkenberg started 20th last weekend in Austria, climbing up to finish ninth.
||
All of those results were dwarfed by his drive at Silverstone, with his colleagues old and new swift to offer their congratulations.
||
Team mate Gabriel Bortoleto was on hand to hug the German as he parked up at the end of the race, saying: “Congratulations to Nico! Seeing him fight for the podium and achieve this result after so many years in Formula 1 means a lot. He is the best teammate I have ever worked with – both as a driver and as a person – and he absolutely deserves this moment: I am genuinely happy for him.”
||
Max Verstappen was also swift to go over to Hulkenberg in parc ferme and shake his hand, before saying afterwards that “the race wasn’t that enjoyable for me but it was nice to see Nico get his first podium and I’m sure he will be celebrating tonight.”
||
Oscar Piastri shared the podium with Hulkenberg, and while the Australian was another left disappointed with their own result, seeing the Sauber driver’s celebrations at least tempered Piastri’s own frustrations.
||
“Well done to Nico – I think that’s the highlight of the day,” Piastri said in his post-race interview.
||
Williams' Carlos Sainz – a former team mate of Hulkenberg at Renault in 2018 – was also hugely complimentary towards the German after he secured his long-awaited podium. “Congrats – he must have done a very solid race to be up there in P3,” the Spaniard told media.
||
“Honestly, for me, the fact that people kept cursing him, the fact that he didn’t have any podiums, for me it was completely irrelevant. For me, he’s always been a top-five driver in the grid every time he’s been in F1 – his level of talent and race execution is incredible.""
||
Williams Team Principal James Vowles also added: “Congratulations to Sauber and to Nico - an extraordinary result today and well-earned in these difficult conditions.”
||
Ferrari driver Lewis Hamilton was the man chasing Hulkenberg in the closing stages of the race, unable to get close enough to steal the podium position and maintain his streak of podium finishes at Silverstone.
||
1 / 3
||
The celebrations continued long after Hulkenberg's podium was confirmed
||
While his own streak came to an end, the Briton praised what the Sauber driver had achieved. “Third place felt within reach at times but credit to Nico on his first podium, he drove a strong race,” Hamilton concluded
||
“Congratulations to Nico for his podium, it's a great achievement for him and his team,” added Hamilton’s team mate Charles Leclerc, before team boss Fred Vasseur gave his own opinion: “Finally, congratulations to Nico on his first podium. Given his undoubted talent, he deserves it.""
||
The last word had to go to Piastri though, who turned to Hulkenberg in the post-race press conference and asked the German how he felt about his first ever F1 trophy being made of... Lego.
||
“I love Lego!” laughed the German. ""It's good. My daughter can play with it too.
||
""You’ve always got to see the bright side. But, you know, a bit of silver or gold would have been nice too, but I won't complain.""

||
Hulkenberg arrived on the F1 grid back in 2010, with his best result up to Sunday’s race – which marked his 239th start – being a fourth-place finish on three occasions.
||
But the 37-year-old changed that statistic with a supreme rise from 19th in tricky, changeable conditions at Silverstone, following the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri home via a spirited defence against Ferrari’s Lewis Hamilton.
||
“It’s been a long time coming, hasn’t it?” Hulkenberg beamed afterwards. “I always knew we have it in us, and I have it in me somewhere.
||
“I mean what a race, coming from virtually last, and doing it all over again from last weekend, was pretty surreal to be honest. Not sure how it all happened, but obviously crazy conditions, mixed conditions – it was a survival fight for a lot of the race.
||
“I think we were just really on it – the right calls, the right tyres in the right moment. We made no mistakes and it’s quite incredible.”
||
After several close podium misses in the past, Hulkenberg continued: “Today, I think I was in denial until the last pit stop, then when I heard we had gapped Lewis quite a bit with the one extra lap I was like, ‘Okay, this is good! This is some breathing space!’
||
“But then he was catching quite quickly. The pressure was there, it was an intense race, but we didn’t crack. No mistakes and obviously really, really happy with that.
||
“Obviously I was thinking that Lewis is going to give it all in front of his home crowd and I was like, ‘Sorry guys – it’s also my day!’ I’ve got to stick my neck out.”
||
Hulkenberg’s fourth successive top-10 finish moves Sauber up to sixth in the Teams’ Championship standings on 41 points, five clear of rivals Racing Bulls and Aston Martin.

"['nico-hulkenberg', 'gabriel-bortoleto']","['Nico Hulkenberg', 'Gabriel Bortoleto']",‘I always knew I was capable of it’ – Bortoleto delighted with first F1 points in Austria amid Alonso battle,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/i-always-knew-i-was-capable-of-it-bortoleto-delighted-with-p8-in-austria.MMTvMLw9SH9hJnv7SwdDP,"Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto brought home his first points of the season at the Red Bull Ring, crossing the line ahead of his team mate Nico Hulkenberg.","Gabriel Bortoleto claimed his maiden points in F1 at the Austrian Grand Prix, rounding off Kick Sauber’s strongest weekend yet as Nico Hulkenberg also finished in the top 10.
||
The Red Bull Ring brought the Brazilian success in his junior career, including his first F2 victory last season, and those previous performances carried forward into the Grand Prix as he achieved his best F1 result so far.
||
After showing improved pace throughout practice, the 20-year-old progressed to the final part of Qualifying for the first time this year, eventually netting P8 on the grid and beating the likes of Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli.
||
He remained in that position when the chequered flag fell, negotiating two pit stops and a meaningful on-track battle with Fernando Alonso, who is coincidentally a member of his management team and mentored him through his stints in F3 and F2.
||
“I feel like we had a very intense battle – probably the most intense battle I have had in F1 so far,” Bortoleto said after the race on the late fight with Alonso. “Outside, inside, and then playing with the blue flags as well with [Lando] Norris and then Oscar [Piastri].
||
“It has been a crazy one, you know? Nothing to say, just a great battle and I’m glad that I’ve been able to fight with Fernando until the end of the race for these points.
||
“We did a great job on the pit stops, we did a great job with the strategy. I feel like we did everything that was in our hands. I just hope that we can keep this up – a weekend like this repeating every single weekend… I think we can score more points in the season and have great results.”
||
Sauber elected to swap Hulkenberg and Bortoleto after the first round of pit stops, allowing the rookie to chase down a bigger points haul. While the gap to Alonso started at nine seconds, he rapidly closed it down and embarked on a multi-lap battle with his mentor.
||
The Spaniard put up an impressive defence, especially with the added challenge of allowing frontrunners Norris and Piastri to pass under blue flags, and held onto P7. He was later spotted congratulating Bortoleto on his mighty drive to take four points.
||
Asked whether it was a relief to finally score, Bortoleto said: “I always knew I was capable of it. I’m not in Formula 1 for a random reason. It’s just good to be in the points finally – more for the team than for myself because they really deserve to have points and everything.
||
“For myself, I’m here because I want to win one day. I’m not going to be happy because I scored a few points, you know? But for sure it’s already an achievement. We should be happy with every small achievement and we are going in the right direction to achieve our bigger dream, which will one day be winning championships.”
||
It was Sauber’s most successful weekend yet in 2025 as Hulkenberg bounced back from starting last on the grid to gain 11 positions and secure another two points, bringing the team into a close fight with Aston Martin and Haas in the team standings.
||
“Obviously got a bit of help from the race circumstances – a few cars dropping out – but nevertheless, I think it was a solid race from us,” Hulkenberg said.
||
“Very positive obviously, double points. From last, I think that’s pretty decent and I’m not sure I could have asked for much more today from there.
||
“Since Barcelona there’s been a change of momentum and I think we have much more of a grip now on the car and on the season. We seem to be performing much better, especially in the race stints, which is obviously very encouraging and where we wanted to be at the start of the season.
||
""We will try to continue this – it’s never easy, we always have to work hard but I’m happy and optimistic for now.”

['nico-hulkenberg'],['Nico Hulkenberg'],‘It’s extremely exciting’ – Can Audi’s F1 arrival finally break Hulkenberg’s podium curse?,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/its-extremely-exciting-can-audis-f1-arrival-finally-break-hulkenbergs-podium.3FewUgghsjaVpKvbanpyN,"F1.com's Lawrence Barretto chats to Nico Hulkenberg about his F1 return with Haas, bringing home the points for Sauber, and Audi's arrivial in 2026.","Nico Hulkenberg is living his best life right now.
||
Three years ago, a return to Formula 1 looked bleak. The German had been on the sidelines since being let go by Renault at the end of 2019. He'd scored points in two super-sub appearances for Racing Point in 2022 – but even then, a full-time return was unlikely. 
||
Then Haas came calling, the American squad were in need of experience, and Hulkenberg had his second act – and a chance to finally end his long wait for a maiden podium (he's currently 240 Grands Prix weekends and counting without a top-three finish).
||
The jury was out as to whether he'd still got it, but it soon became clear Hulkenberg's time out of the sport had done him the world of good. 
||
An enforced sabbatical had given him an appreciation of how much F1 meant to him and how much he needed it. It gave him a new perspective on racing, too. 
||
So, when he returned, Hulkenberg looked like he'd never been away. While the Haas wasn't good enough in race trim in 2023, the German could still show his quality in Qualifying. 
||
""When I came back in 2023 with Haas, it was like a new girlfriend,"" he says when we chat on the balcony of Sauber's hospitality at the Canadian Grand Prix, a race after his superb fifth-place finish at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in Spain. 
||
""I had a fresh love. I still feel in love. I like coming to the racetracks, doing all the travels, putting in the hours to work with the team and the factory before and after the events. 
||
""There is nothing I'd rather be doing. I enjoy it and there's lots to look forward to with next year coming up.""
||
It's no wonder Hulkenberg says life is good. The 37-year-old, who turns 38 in August and is the third oldest driver on the grid, has hit the ground running with Sauber, who were (points-wise) F1’s worst team last year.
||
He's made the most of an improved chassis and, more recently, an upgrade package that has hauled the team into being a regular points contender in a ruthlessly tight midfield. 
||
Hulkenberg has 20 points on the board after 10 races – that's more than Sauber have scored in the previous two years combined. 
||
Fifth in Spain was Hulkenberg's best result since the 2019 Italian Grand Prix in Monza – and came thanks to a sweet moment when he overtook Lewis Hamilton’s Ferrari for the position on track (see the clip below).
||
Consistency has been Hulkenberg's trademark and he's shown that brilliantly this year, outperforming his highly-rated rookie team mate Gabriel Bortoleto.
||
""Obviously, [my experience has been] quite handy and helpful in many situations,"" he says. ""I have to be sharp, because Gabi is really bringing the heat to the table. 
||
""He's a youngster, he's a rookie, but he's very impressive. The speed, how clinically he drives, his approach, his attitude, how hard he works. 
||
""I know he hasn't had a result yet, but really that's just a matter of time, because he's got it all. He's very impressive and he's definitely pushing me.""
||
This is the calibre of driver Audi – who will make Sauber their works team from next season – had hoped they would be getting when signing him on a long-term deal from this year. 
||
They wanted someone fast who can deliver results consistently while driving the team forward and dovetailing with their young rookie whom they signed from McLaren's junior programme. 
||
Audi know they have a big job on their hands to hit the ground running when they debut next year, bringing with them their own power unit built to sweeping new regulations. 
||
Hulkenberg bet on Audi getting it right with their first foray in F1 – and while he is pleased with how the team is progressing in readiness of the German manufacturer's arrival, he is aware that Audi's anticipated performance is a ""big unknown"". 
||
The German one-time polesitter adds: ""It's such a reset and a white piece of paper that everyone starts from. It's impossible to predict anything.
||
""The big four teams have an advantage in terms of infrastructure and all these kinds of things. But it's a good opportunity, because it is a reset, it is a fresh start for everyone with these new regulations.
||
""It's extremely exciting and a good opportunity for everyone, including ourselves. We need to work hard, we need to work focused on it and hopefully we'll come out on the right side of it.""
||
Hulkenberg – whose F1 career spans back to 2010 – has never been in the right place at the right time and never got the chance to move to a big team when his form warranted it. 
||
After driving for Williams, Force India, Sauber, Renault, Racing Point, Aston Martin, Haas and now Sauber again, maybe – just maybe – this move will be the move for the German.
||
Then it's down to Hulkenberg to keep doing what he's doing, and perhaps he'll finally get that elusive podium he’s been chasing for so long.

['nico-hulkenberg'],['Nico Hulkenberg'],Hulkenberg says upgrades are ‘paying dividends’ for Kick Sauber as he scores for second race in a row,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/hulkenberg-says-upgrades-are-paying-dividends-for-kick-sauber-as-he-scores.1Z2JjsjUkCK7UkEKxFVkB4,"Nico Hulkenberg converted his P11 grid slot to an eighth-place finish in Canada, as he scored more vital points for Kick Sauber.","Nico Hulkenberg is starting to make a habit of scoring points, as the Kick Sauber driver came home eighth in Canada to add to his brilliant fifth last time out in Spain.
||
His recent run of results has lifted Kick Sauber from the bottom of the table in the Teams’ Championship, and they are now just eight points off P6 as the midfield pack tightens up once again.
||
For Sauber, it is further proof that their upgrade direction is the right one, with Hulkenberg able to use his updated car to good effect when fighting his midfield rivals. While he didn’t quite have the pace to catch the Ferraris, like in Barcelona, the German was still proud of a race that included some “fun” overtakes.
||
“Well two times in [the top 10 in] a row, that’s nice!,” Hulkenberg said after the race in Montreal. ""Would be nice if we can continue the trend from here but obviously definitely some momentum on our side.
||
“A bit as I suspected in race trim the car comes alive a bit more, the update really paying dividends and just having better consistency and a better balance in the car so yeah quite pleasant, made some good gains.
||
“Franco [Colapinto] and Alex [Albon] were fighting in Turn 9 Lap 1 and I managed to capitalise on that and was a pretty clean race. A couple of overtakes to do, pretty fun racing and managing tyres basically.”
||
Hulkenberg’s race craft remains sharp, the German more than happy to pounce on that opening lap when his rivals tangled, before executing a one-stop strategy that saw him make his hard tyres last 51 laps.
||
While his drive lacked the showiness of his Barcelona race, where he overtook Lewis Hamilton’s Ferrari, it was his third score of the season and first in a race that didn’t feature variables like rain or mid-race Safety Cars.
||
As such, there are high hopes of more points at the coming races – regardless of the characteristics of the tracks in question. Hulkenberg was asked if he can keep scoring, and he was clear that he sees no reason why he won’t be featuring in the top 10 more often moving forward.
||
“We’ve had two very different tracks here and in Barcelona"" he said. ""On both we were competitive in the midfield so there’s no reason to think why not.”
||
Team Principal Jonathan Wheatley was also quick to praise Hulkenberg’s drive in Montreal, as the team’s one-stop strategy “proved to be spot on,"" calling the atmosphere within the squad ""fantastic.""

||
With Alonso on his way to a strong seventh-placed finish in the race, Bortoleto – who belongs to the Aston Martin man's Driver Management programme – charged up behind and came incredibly close to picking off Alonso on the very last lap.
||
With the Aston Martin man opting for the one-stop in Austria, and with Bortoleto's tyres 16 laps fresher, the Spanish two-time World Champion defended hard against his mentee.
||
However, luck was also on Alonso's side as race winner Lando Norris closed in to take the chequered flag, meaning both had to cede to the McLaren.
||
Not only did that hand Alonso DRS, but it also ensured that the battling cars took the chequered flag behind Norris and thus had one lap less to complete.
||
Alonso certainly used all his experience to hang onto P7 – but afterwards, he was as overjoyed for his young charge as he was about his own result, going straight to the Brazilian for a heartwarming hug as they climbed out of their cars in parc ferme.
||
“Incredible, happy for him,” Alonso said about Bortoleto’s first points in F1.
||
“Gabi was outstanding the whole season, for one reason or another [Nico] Hulkenberg was then scoring the points on Sunday. But I think [Bortoleto] deserved maybe before this one to score already but I hope for him it is the first of many.
||
“The first points in Formula 1, they taste always very special.“
||
As for how his race unfolded, Alonso was full of praise for his team, who succesfully tried the one-stop, even with track temperatures hitting 50C and tyre degradation extremely high as a result.
||
“It was intense,"" Alonso explained. ""Look, the first thing was the strategy. The team was right, the one-stop strategy was the one to go for today, it was the fastest as I was not as fast as the Kick Sauber or the Haas and I still finished in front of them.
||
“The one-stop was the right choice, good pit stop, good timing as well. And then at the end I got lucky as when Gabi came with a lot better pace, I had Norris with the blue flags so Gabi could not attack me on the last laps. And it meant the race was one lap shorter as, by letting Norris go, we saw the chequered flag so all in all, it was a perfect combo for us.”
||
Lance Stroll was unable to score on Sunday, coming home 14th for Aston Martin, who remain eighth in the Championship. Thanks to Alonso’s points though, they have closed up to Haas and are just one point behind the American outfit heading into Silverstone.

||
The Brazilian, who won last year’s F2 Championship, had experienced success at the circuit in his junior career. In 2023, he claimed second place in the F3 Feature Race, and followed that up with an F2 race win the following year – his first of the season.
||
Bortoleto is one of two drivers (the other being fellow F2 graduate Franco Colapinto) without a point this year, but this round offers his greatest opportunity yet to cross the line in the top 10.
||
He has achieved this feat in every session of the weekend so far, finding his rhythm quickly at a track that has produced so much success for him in recent years as he also finished each practice hour in sixth, eighth and 10th respectively.
||
Speaking after Qualifying, he said: “I’m very pleased – first Q3 of my career in such a special place like the Red Bull Ring. It’s always been a track I loved.
||
“In F3 I finished in second I think, fighting for the win. In F2, winning – not only in the series but also in other series, it’s always been a special place. Making it to Q3 at this track is a very special thing for me.”
||
Outqualifying his Kick Sauber team mate Nico Hulkenberg, who is set to start the race from P20, Bortoleto will face the challenge of lining up alongside an out of position Max Verstappen at lights out.
||
With Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli just behind him in ninth place, he was asked about the prospect of taking the fight to the more traditional frontrunners in a car that has thus far failed to finish higher than P12.
||
The 20-year-old said: “I think it will be difficult with Max, you know? I think he got the yellow flag on his lap and he should be in the top three, top four where he always is, making miracles sometimes with the car he has.
||
“He has more potential than the result he got today but only because he got unlucky. Kimi, I think he’s also doing a very good job and I don’t know, let’s see tomorrow how the race pace is.
||
“I think I can maybe fight with him for sure. I think the whole weekend I have been strong and compared to him as well, I don’t remember exactly the positions but I know we were very close to each other the whole weekend.”

||
Revealed by Slawn along with Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar at the Flannels X store in London this evening, the link-up sees the VCARB 02 adorned with Slawn’s caricature style street art.
||
The artwork will also feature on the drivers’ race suits and the team’s kit across the weekend, while Slawn will also be in the paddock on Thursday alongside Lawson and Hadjar where the squad say he will be “designing the garage IRL”.
||
Slawn’s famed graffiti aesthetic – rooted in his Yoruba heritage and London’s urban culture – has seen him make his name in the city’s art landscape. He has also previously made a foray into the world of sports, having designed the Emirates FA Cup Trophy in May this year.
||
Racing Bulls say of the collaboration: “His work challenges traditional art norms and thrives on hype and disruption, making it a perfect synergy between VCARB and HUGO.”
||
Peter Bayer, the team’s CEO, said: “Slawn’s work is unlike anything we’ve seen in Formula 1, and that’s exactly why this collaboration felt right. Partnering with HUGO and Slawn has allowed us to push creative boundaries in a way that reflects the bold identity of our team.
||
“Silverstone is a massive moment in the season, and we’re proud to bring something completely original to our fans.”
||
Slawn commented: ""Art meets speed, and I brought the madness. Big love to HUGO and VCARB for trusting the vision.”
||
James Foster, SVP of Global Marketing at HUGO BOSS, added: “Witnessing the big reveal of Slawn’s fresh, energetic art on the VCARB Team’s new livery and his exciting takeover will consolidate HUGO’s ambition to take F1 further off-track and into culture.
||
“This collaboration is a brilliant demonstration of the power of going your own way, which is at the core of HUGO and VCARB’s DNA. All eyes will be on VCARB during the action at Silverstone.”

||
The Racing Bulls driver came close to being taken out by Mercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli in Turn 3, with the two banging wheels as the Italian locked up and sailed straight on.
||
While Lawson narrowly avoided a race-ending crash, it was his former Red Bull team mate Max Verstappen instead that took the brunt of the collision, with both he and Antonelli forced to retire from the Grand Prix then and there.
||
Lawson put that bit of luck to good use as he went on to secure sixth, one of just two drivers to make a one-stop strategy work in Spielberg. With track temperatures passing 50C, making a set of tyres last was tricky – but Lawson was aided by having Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso on his tail.
||
Alonso was the second driver on a one-stop, and he was able to provide a buffer to some quicker two-stopping cars behind – even if the sight of the Spaniard in his wing mirrors all afternoon did nothing for Lawson’s heart rate.
||
“I’m a bit lost to be honest, it was a very tough race,” Lawson told Sky Sports F1. ""Especially after Lap 1, I don’t know how I survived it to be honest.
||
“I thought – when I saw Kimi coming I was like, okay, this is over. But somehow, we got out of it. And then the speed was good, we made the one-stop work which was key for us. With the temperatures I wasn’t sure about it, but the team knew, so very, very happy.
||
“It is always Fernando who is behind, I think he was within DRS for 70 laps today! And you try not to make a mistake. I thought he was quicker, but I just spoke to him and he thought I was quicker, and he was using me to keep DRS!”
||
Lawson managed to make his hard tyres last 38 laps on Sunday, two longer than Alonso. But his team mate had an even tougher ask – Isack Hadjar made to do a 41-lap stint on his hard tyre.
||
That was despite the rookie two-stopping, the Frenchman forced into a very early opening stop after running wide twice on the opening lap to avoid contact. He did fight his way back up into the points, only to drop down the order late on.
||
At first it looked like his tyres had finally run out of life, but later Hadjar confirmed it was floor damage that prevented him scoring in Austria.
||
“We did a very good race,” Hadjar said. “We were comfortably in the points, and 15 laps towards the end of the race we got floor damage.
||
“I mean I thought P8 was secure, and then I was losing more than a second per lap. And yeah, that was a tough end to the race.”
||
The Racing Bulls rookie was told the damage was acquired through Turn 1, “probably the sausage kerb,” and reflected that all in all, it was a “shame.” This was the first time since Lawson returned to the team that he has managed to beat Hadjar on a Sunday, as he recorded just his second top 10 of the season.

||
Lawson started the 2025 campaign at the senior Red Bull team but was demoted after two challenging race weekends and has since been trying to rebuild his confidence.
||
After flashes of promise, this weekend’s visit to the Red Bull Ring has seen Lawson step it up a gear – the New Zealander building on strong practice pace to reach Q3 and brilliantly post the sixth-fastest time.
||
With that marking his best grid position since last year’s Sao Paulo Grand Prix, which he started from fifth, Lawson beamed: “It feels like it’s been a long time! It’s really cool to have a good Quali.
||
“We see everything behind the scenes and in the last couple of races everything’s felt really good, honestly. I’ve felt really good. We’ve done a lot of work on the car, and on my side as well, just to make it more comfortable for me.
||
“It’s been there, it just hasn’t shown, so it’s nice to show it today, but obviously tomorrow is also the important day.”
||
Pressed on what has made the difference so far this weekend, he continued: “A smooth Quali, honestly. The last couple of weekends the pace has been there through practice – Canada was strong, Barcelona was strong, and just in Quali it wasn’t.
||
“This weekend, of all the weekends to get it across the line, it’s been cool because it’s so close. It puts pressure on us behind the wheel to execute, and same on the team.
||
“With the car we’ve been fine-tuning all weekend and we don’t have time to miss anything, because everybody else is chasing as well. It’s cool to get it across the line!”
||
Lawson has just one points finish to his name this season, courtesy of a run to eighth place at the Monaco Grand Prix, but he is optimistic of adding another in Spielberg.
||
“I hope so!” Lawson said of his chances. “At the same time, the [tyre degradation] is decent, and the long runs are tricky. We had a good long run [in practice], but it’s always different in a race when you’re in traffic, and I’m sure there’s going to be a mix of strategies.”
||
Lawson’s rookie team mate, Isack Hadjar, experienced a more challenging session as he dropped out during the Q2 phase and will start Sunday’s race from 13th.
||
“It’s disappointing, because Q1 was looking really good,” the Frenchman reflected. “Even my Q1 lap would have qualified me for Q3, so I don’t know how we can go backwards from that.
||
“Usually we make progress and it wasn’t the case today, so it’s very disappointing. It was very inconsistent in Q2, on both new sets of tyres as well, so it’s hard to understand.”

||
After starting on the medium tyres from P12 on the grid – having received a three-place grid drop for impeding Williams’ Carlos Sainz during Qualifying – Hadjar ran a one-stop strategy but lost further positions during the race.
||
A final result of 16th place meant that the Frenchman failed to score points for the first time since the Miami Grand Prix in May.
||
Reflecting on the struggles that affected his afternoon at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, Hadjar explained: “I think we just pitted a bit too late. We had high graining at the start of the race and we lost a few positions in the pits.
||
“After that it was just a DRS train and towards the end I was lacking so much pace compared to the cars around. I just got overtaken by everyone.”
||
When quizzed on why the weekend had seemingly been a particularly challenging one for the Racing Bulls squad, Hadjar conceded that he had not felt content with the VCARB 02 from early on in the event.
||
“I think since the start of the weekend, even [on Saturday] I was not happy with the car,” the 20-year-old said. “I feel like on the one lap I can kind of make a difference, but over 70 laps there’s no chance.”

It was also a tricky few days in Montreal for Lawson. The New Zealander started the race from the pit lane after changes were made to his car under parc ferme conditions, including a new power unit being fitted.
||
However, this did not prove to be enough to move him up the order and he eventually retired on Lap 53 owing to a cooling issue.
||
“It’s disappointing,” the 23-year-old commented. “I think obviously it was going to be a very difficult race anyway from the pit lane, but we had a cooling issue at the end so unfortunately we had to retire. It’s just been a tough weekend, which is a shame.”
||
Like Hadjar, Lawson gave his take on why the weekend in Montreal had proven particularly tough for Racing Bulls and admitted that the squad now need to regroup.
||
“[It] was a pretty specific thing we struggled with in Qualifying, but the pace of the car was actually quite good,” said Lawson.
||
“And then obviously what happened in the race today is a little bit out of our control, so it’s a shame but obviously we’ve just got to keep resetting and looking ahead.”
||
The team will now set to preparing for the upcoming double header of Austria and Great Britain, with the former kicking things off at the Red Bull Ring on June 27-29.

"['lance-stroll', 'fernando-alonso']","['Lance Stroll', 'Fernando Alonso']",Alonso urges Aston Martin to ‘close the gap’ to top teams ahead despite scoring points in Canada,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/alonso-happy-to-head-up-midfield-but-wants-aston-martin-to-close-the-gap-to.4W33NQAo4FS2yHxnZeWgVk,Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll have been giving their take on their respective races in Canada.,"Fernando Alonso insisted Aston Martin still ""need to close that gap"" to the teams ahead of them, despite the Spanish star scoring in both Spain and Canada after not managing a single point across the opening eight races of 2025.
||
Alonso qualified a brilliant sixth in Montreal and delivered a seventh-place finish in the race – only losing out to Charles Leclerc’s Ferrari as Alonso came home at the front of the midfield. The turnaround has been stark, with luck finally smiling down on the Spaniard too.
||
Having already endured more than his fair share of reliability concerns, Canada was a straightforward weekend for Alonso, with his team nailing their tyre strategy throughout the sessions to ensure he had the right compound to qualify well.
||
That set him up for a tilt at points, and despite getting bogged down in traffic after his first pit stop, he always looked set to score at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve.
||
“Quite happy, I think the car was good the whole weekend,” Alonso said. ""Actually, the race was probably our least strong point of the weekend.
||
“Thanks to the sixth position yesterday in Qualifying, we kept the pace at the beginning of the race and we opened a gap that was a little bit our safety net for the pit stops and things like that. Good weekend, we executed well and good points for the team.”
||
The upgrades that Aston Martin brought to the car at the start of that European triple-header seem to have made a significant difference as, before that point, Alonso had not qualified in Q3 all season, with a best of P12.
||
Since the upgrades he has made Q3 at every race, but the Spaniard was keen not to get ahead of himself – especially considering that, relative to a couple of seasons ago when he was fighting for podiums and even a potential win, Aston Martin still have work to do.
||
“It gives us a little bit more confidence to push but there are still some weaknesses in the car since the beginning that we still not solved completely. Especially on the race pace on Sunday we see the problems.
||
“Still a lot of work to do, today we led the midfield but the top teams are still quite far away and we need to close that gap.”
||
Lance Stroll was unable to score points on home soil after a difficult comeback weekend in Canada. He exited Qualifying in Q1, and then found himself serving a 10-second penalty during the race for forcing another driver off track when he was battling with Pierre Gasly, eventually finishing 17th.
||
""It's been a long, rough day and I'm not so pleased with this weekend overall,” Stroll explained after the race. “It was always going to be difficult starting the race from P17, but I also didn't feel like the car had the pace today to make up any positions.”
||
The two drivers are experiencing contrasting seasons – Stroll having scored in the opening two races before beginning a barren run, while Alonso only scored in the last two weekends. But Aston Martin will be relieved that Alonso’s points in Canada have kept them ahead of a resurgent Kick Sauber for the time being in the Teams' Championship.

||
Following a difficult start to the season, Alonso claimed his first points of the campaign last time out in Spain and will be looking to continue that momentum at Round 10 on the calendar in Montreal, a venue that the two-time World Champion previously won at back in 2006.

FP2: Russell narrowly leads Norris and Antonelli in Canada after Stroll strikes the wall
||
After classifying in P12 on the timesheets in first practice, Alonso caught the eye by going fifth quickest in Free Practice 2. However, while he later admitted that the AMR25 had been feeling good, the Spaniard acknowledged that the team's true position may not become apparent until later in the weekend.
||
When asked where he feels that the squad are after Friday’s running, Alonso explained: “Difficult to guess. I think this track is always… It was good for us, I think the car feels good, but still not an easy circuit to put a lap together.
||
“You have to try many times, and sometimes it’s in Turn 3, sometimes it’s in the last corner, but you have to take these escape roads and it’s always difficult to put everything together.
||
“It’s going to be the same tomorrow, so we have to be focused, we have to be lucky also in putting the lap in [at] the right time.
||
HIGHLIGHTS: Catch the action as Russell tops second practice in Canada
||
“Also the tyres, they seem to take a [few] laps to get into temperature, but then when they are in temperature they grain, so there’s only one or two laps where you can be performing. So I think it’s going to be the same tomorrow, interesting.”
||
Much of the field only ran the soft tyre during second practice, yet it was the medium rubber on which George Russell set the fastest lap of the day.
||
In terms of whether the C5 compound might be a Qualifying tyre on Saturday, Alonso responded: “We don’t know. We know the track is getting grippier throughout the weekend, it’s a street circuit so a lot of track evolution. I think we want to do our proper test tomorrow in FP3.”
||
Alonso became Aston Martin’s sole runner for much of FP2 after team mate Lance Stroll suffered an early crash that put him out of the session. The Canadian later put the incident down to “a bit of understeer” before touching the wall.

||
Ocon managed his strategy well in Spielberg, starting on the medium tyre before pitting early for a set of the hards, after a disappointing Qualifying left him towards the back of the grid.
||
He then ran a long second stint before bolting on more hard tyres, and just held onto the last points paying position, with his team mate Ollie Bearman backing him up in P11.
||
“I’m very happy, looking at where we were in Qualifying it’s a great recovery by the whole team,” said Ocon after the race. “We got a point for consolation but it means a lot as it shows we have a really good race car.
||
“We just need a bit more in Qualifying, trying to get a bit more performance. The car was very solid and reliable, and I thank the team for that – as we ended in the interesting positions at the end.
||
“It was tough racing out there today, how I like it, but it was a bit too tough perhaps because it could’ve cost us a lot more – but we should be pleased with the point.”
||
With hindsight, team boss Ayao Komatsu felt an opportunity was missed, with Liam Lawson and Fernando Alonso both making a one-stop race work and both ending up heading the midfield.
||
“To get to P10 from P17 is positive – normally a very good result,” he explained. ""What’s not as good is with Esteban I think we could’ve done even better.
||
“Esteban’s driving was really good, his first and second stints were so strong, I feel we may have pitted just a bit early on the first stop. That eliminated the chance to do a one-stop race with him which I think we could’ve done with his tyre management and pace.”
||
As for Bearman, despite starting ahead of his team mate in P15, he came home just behind him – although he was able to act as a buffer for Ocon in the closing stages.
||
“We really struggled in the middle stint and that’s where my race came undone,” he explained afterwards. ""The final run was a bit better but I had to go quite early onto the mediums, so it was another long stint.”
||
While the team were happy with their recovery, Haas saw plenty of their midfield rivals score big in Austria – with Aston Martin just one point back thanks to Alonso’s seventh, while Kick Sauber are now three points back after a double points finish.

||
Ocon had lined up in P14 on the grid in Montreal alongside team mate Ollie Bearman in P13, though the squad opted to split strategies by starting Ocon on the hard tyres while Bearman had bolted on the medium compound.
||
Both drivers embarked on a one-stop plan – but this seemed to play out better for Ocon, who ran a long opening stint before switching to the medium tyres and making them last to the chequered flag to secure ninth place.
||
“[I’m] very pleased, very pleased with the whole work that the team did this weekend,” the 28-year-old reflected after the race. “I think we maximised the potential.
||
“It was not clear-cut that that strategy was going to be better before the race, but it paid off to take the risk and we managed to deliver a very solid one, solid laps in clean air, which was important so we overcut quite a lot of cars.
||
“And then we brought the car home to seal the position at the end with the Safety Car, so quite a [hard] race but very good nevertheless.”
||
When asked how good it had felt to gain from taking that strategy gamble – particularly given the fine margins at play in the midfield battle – Ocon responded: “Yeah, it’s a good reward to the team, to get something out of our 200th race.
||
“Obviously it is important to seal every opportunity that there is out there, because they don’t come all the time, and this weekend we did so [I'm] very pleased with that.”
||
For Bearman it proved to be a more frustrating afternoon at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, with the Briton struggling to make ground after finding himself stuck in traffic.
||
But while ending the race in P11 meant that he just missed out on points, Bearman felt that there were still positives to take in terms of the pace of the VF-25.
||
“I think honestly we had a bit more pace in the car today, just with the strategy we ended up stuck in the traffic with the people starting on the hard tyre, and with the DRS train it’s really, really impossible to overtake,” the 20-year-old conceded.
||
“We had a lot more in the car and once I got free air I had good pace, but I spent the whole race stuck in the DRS and it’s difficult to overtake. [I’m] happy, but there could have been a bit more today.”
||
Pushed on whether it feels as if Haas are continuing to make progress in their understanding of the car, Bearman answered: “Yeah, I would say so.
||
“I think Fridays are still our weak point – we seem to be a bit less competitive on Fridays relative to the rest of the weekend, but I’m glad that the team have scored points this weekend and let’s keep pushing for the next one.”

Succeeding in Formula 1 is not easy. In the recent years before Haas joined the sport, Marussia, Lotus and HRT came (briefly) and went. But Haas bucked the trend.
||
Founded by Nascar team boss Gene Haas and led by former Jaguar managing director Guenther Steiner, the team scored points on debut with Romain Grosjean and have since become a strong force within the sport's competitive midfield.

Throughout their time in the sport, Haas have been the smallest team on the grid, both in terms of personnel and budget. They've regularly punched above their weight – but also gone through some really tough times, including their first (and as yet only) point-less season in 2021 and the battle (like many of their rivals) to survive the Covid-19 pandemic.

""I think our first race in 2016, scoring that point on the debut [was a highlight],"" Komatsu said. ""Literally coming to Australia, everybody was on their knees. Car build was tough, pre-season testing was really tough, then get to Australia, that's the first time we're actually building two cars at the same time, so that's a huge pressure.
||
""And then to score that amazing point, great, and then going on to the next race, then we executed that amazing three-stop race with Romain P5, that was incredible. Since then we've had amazing P4, P5 in Austria, a pole position with Kevin in Interlagos – just so many moments I look back and I'm really proud of everyone in the team.
||
""2019 was pretty tough because 2016 we started very well and 2017, 2018 we are making progress and 2019 we started okay, but then our development didn't work and then we never solved it.
||
""So the team actually went backwards during 2019, and I didn't feel like we are really addressing the issues and we are going forward, so 2019 was pretty tough.
||
""Then Covid happened, almost at the worst point, where the team started having an issue but were not being able to address it, almost everything had to shut down, and then stand still.

||
""To survive that period was really, really tough, and I remember some of the guys left after 2021, then they recently came back and said, wow, from that point now, it's just totally different.
||
""So those were tough days, but I'm really glad that Gene stuck with us, and now the team is improving. Honestly, for me, it really comes down to the transparency, openness, and communication, and not having the blame culture.""

Haas entered the sport with a different model, the American outfit forging a tight relationship with Ferrari that allowed it to legally take a suite of parts from the Italian marque, including their power unit. They also worked with Dallara, who looked after the chassis – and just last year, they added another significant partner in the shape of Toyota.
||
""I think we've got a good foundation to grow from this point,"" Komatsu emphasized.
||
READ MORE: What the teams said – Qualifying in Canada
||
Komatsu is speaking just over 18 months since he took over as Team Principal as a replacement for Steiner. At the time, the team were at the bottom of the Constructors' Championship having scored just 12 points the previous season.
||
But having predicted the team would be off the pace after a disruptive off-season, Haas regrouped quickly (having started very early on their 2024-spec car) and scored their biggest points haul since 2018 to take a super seventh, just missing out in their fight with Alpine for P6.
||
They've remained consistent this year, scoring in four races to sit seventh and just a couple of points behind Racing Bulls. It feels like the team, who got a new motorhome this year for the first time since they entered the sport, are in a very good place after 10 years. What, then, does the next decade hold for the American team?
||
""We'd like to establish ourselves at the top of the midfield,"" he said. ""Consistently contend in that level. Only when we achieve that level, I think I can think about the next level.
||
""How do we get closer to the top three, top four teams? You know, but that's something that comes in the next phase. I think we need to just focus on slightly more shorter term. Yes, it's good to have that vision.

""We don't want to stay where we are. We have a big ambition. We want to get the podium at some point. But if I say to my team, okay, let's get a podium. But how? Without a strategy, it's just a word. It doesn't mean anything.
||
""It's very important to have that long-term ambition but then having a clear idea of how we can improve the team short-term, mid-term.""

||
It was back in 2016 at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix that the Haas team made their debut in F1, a race that saw them score their maiden points thanks to Romain Grosjean crossing the line in P6.
||
GALLERY: Check out Haas’ special livery for their 200th Grand Prix in Canada
||
Since then the American outfit have endured various highs and lows in the sport, with their strongest finish to date being fifth place in the 2018 Teams’ Championship, while the squad’s best race result was a fourth scored in that same year by Grosjean at the Austrian Grand Prix.
||
Now, as they enter into their 200th race, Haas are set to mark the occasion with a special livery for the upcoming weekend in Montreal that harks back to the original design sported on their car back in 2016.
||
Despite only joining the outfit full-time this year, Bearman is honoured to be a part of their continuing journey through Formula 1.
||
“I'm very proud of the team and how far they've come,” the Briton said. “Of course it's strange to say, I've only been there for 10 races, but they are the youngest team in F1 and to hit such an incredible milestone of 200 races is very special.
||

||
“I'm very happy for them and glad to have played a very small part in their fantastic journey.”
||
Looking back on Grosjean’s points-scoring result on Haas’ debut, Bearman added: “I've spoken to Romain a bit because he's been at a few races, and listening to how far the team has come since then is a very special feeling to see as well.
||
“There are a few people who have been there since the beginning, like Ayao [Komatsu, Team Principal], and it's nice to see the loyalty and how hard he has been working for us.”
||
While he would not make his own F1 debut until later in 2016 for the Manor team, Ocon can also recall Haas’ first-ever race and the moment that Grosjean claimed sixth for the squad.
||
“I remember Romain's radio message saying, 'Welcome to Formula 1, guys,’” Ocon explained during media day in Montreal. “That [P6] was pretty impressive I would say. Definitely a nice first race and we are wearing these colours this weekend, the full suit, the livery.
||

||
“We have team members' [names] on the front wing as well written down, and it's a nice little throwback and I hope that this will bring us luck this weekend.”
||
While the milestone will make this weekend’s event a “special race” for Haas, Ocon also admitted that the team need to work hard in order to keep up with their rivals.
||
“I think the good thing is that, when we were able to have decent pace, we've managed to take opportunities and get the result and score some decent points, like [in] Monaco,” the Frenchman said of the recent triple header sequence.
||
“But we need to work a little bit more on the consistency, try and get more performance out of the car when the track doesn't necessarily suit our package.
||
“We are working on all of that with the team, and I hope that we can get a little bit more out of this weekend and the next ones because obviously it's very tight throughout the whole grid.

“Everyone is improving, there are no people that are not dangerous at the moment so it is interesting out there. We need to be on top of our game.”
||
Bearman echoed those sentiments following a more challenging outing in Spain, with the Briton conceding: “It was a tough one for us in Barcelona. I think made tougher by the fact that some rivals had some good results.
||
“Good for them, but shows that we still have a bit of work to do. This is a big milestone race for us and I'm really happy to be here and it's a very special moment for the entire team, but of course a good performance would be great.”

['oliver-bearman'],['Oliver Bearman'],"'It sucks' – Bearman laments 'silly, dumb' error as penalty undoes strong British GP Qualifying",https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/it-sucks-bearman-laments-silly-dumb-error-as-penalty-undoes-strong-british.6VUvRnvOyc1rXjBRueQVLB,Ollie Bearman has lamented his mistake which earned the Haas driver a 10-place grid penalty for the British Grand Prix.,"Ollie Bearman has branded his mistake in final practice, which earned the Haas driver a 10-place grid penalty for the British Grand Prix as ""silly"" and ""dumb"" having then achieved his best Qualifying result.
||
The Briton, who will compete in his home Grand Prix for the first time this weekend, showed impressive pace at Silverstone on Saturday, eventually setting the eighth fastest lap, which was his best F1 Qualifying performance to date.
||
But the 20-year-old will start towards the back of the grid having suffered an unusual incident in the final practice session earlier in the morning, losing control of his Haas and hitting the wall on the entry to the pits.
||
The collision, which ripped the front wing from his car, took place under red flag conditions after Gabriel Bortoleto's accident left his Kick Sauber stranded.
||
The stewards noted that Bearman ""did not drive slowly back to the pit lane"" and did not consider cold tyres and brakes to be ""a mitigating factor"", as he was slapped with the grid penalty and four penalty points.
||
When asked about the penalty in the wake of his strong Qualifying performance, Bearman told Sky Sports F1: ""It sucks. Quite honestly it's horrible, but I can only blame myself for that. It was my fault and a very silly error this morning.
||
""On the other hand I'm really glad we had a good Qualifying. First of all, to validate the team's hard work because we brought an upgrade this weekend and we were in Q3 on merit, so that's great.
||
""Qualifying has been our weak point for the past couple of events and now to be in Q3 on a track where there's lots of high-speed, which across the season has not been our strongest feature, is a great feeling. I know I'm going to start from last tomorrow but I'll see what I can do.""
||
The 10-place grid drop is the second such penalty for Bearman this season, after the Haas driver passed Carlos Sainz's Williams under red flag conditions during a practice session for the Monaco Grand Prix.
||
Bearman so far has scored points in three races this term, with the last one coming in Bahrain back in April.
||
""We were doing a very slow lap during the red flag and then coming into the pit entry with very cold tyres and brakes I didn't really account for that,"" said Bearman on the incident in final practice.
||
""Just a silly, dumb error because when I hit the brakes they were stone-cold and so were the tyres and I lost it. Silly and really kicking myself. I wish I could go back and change it but we can't so let's learn from it and hopefully we can have a good race.""

||
The session had already proven eventful for Bearman, the Haas driver earlier sparking a red flag after losing a piece of bodywork from his car out on track which resulted in the marshals having to retrieve the part.
||
But there was worse to come for the Briton when a second red flag was thrown in the latter stages owing to Kick Sauber’s Gabriel Bortoleto spinning off and becoming beached in the gravel.
||
As he headed into the pit lane, Bearman had a spin of his own and hit the barriers, losing the front wing from his VF-25 in the process.
||
With the incident happening under red flag conditions, it was subsequently investigated by the stewards who opted to hand the 20-year-old a grid drop of 10 places for Sunday’s race.
||
A document released following the stewards’ hearing reads: “Car 87 had slowed down for the red flag and as he was approaching Turn 15 accelerated significantly to race pace and entered the pit entry road at 260kph. He lost control of the car in the pit entry road and crashed into the barriers.
||
“Art. 37.6 (a) of the Formula One Sporting Regulations and Art. 2.5.4.1(b) of Appendix H of the International Sporting Code require that when a red flag is shown ‘all cars must immediately reduce speed and proceed slowly back to the pit lane’.
||
“It is beyond doubt that the driver of Car 87 did not proceed slowly back to the pit lane when he accelerated to simulate entering into the pit entry road under race conditions.
||
“In fact, we looked at a previous in-lap under normal racing conditions and found that he was faster in this lap, under a red flag.
||
“To make matters worse, he lost control of the car and crashed into the barriers while at speed. The driver informed us that he misjudged the fact that his brakes were not warm because the lap was done slowly, due to the red flag.
||
“While this may have been a factor contributing to the crash, we did not consider it to be a mitigating factor.”
||
As well as the grid penalty, Bearman has also received four penalty points, bringing the total on his licence up to eight.
||
The British driver is competing in his first home Grand Prix as an F1 driver, with last year’s event at Silverstone being where the youngster’s deal to race for Haas in 2025 was announced.

||
With Gasly running sixth at the end of the opening lap in Spielberg, there were high hopes for a significant number of points for Alpine. However, after starting on the soft tyres, the Frenchman was forced into an early pit stop – with his race unravelling afterwards.
||
Calling it “a very disappointing afternoon,” Gasly was unable to explain why he then could not extract much pace from either the hard or medium compound tyres on Sunday, despite the majority of the teams going well on those compounds.
||
“We have a lot to understand and analyse as I just felt a lack of grip all race and really struggled across all the stints,” Gasly said.
||
“I am not sure why, maybe some damage to the car, maybe not, but we need to review this one in detail as it was a very long afternoon and a frustrating outcome.
||
“We had a very good start, up to sixth place at the end of the first lap. After that, there is not much to say other than it being a difficult race.
||
""We move onto Silverstone straight away now for the home race of Enstone. It is always a fantastic event and one I look forward to going to, this time aiming to bounce back from this tough weekend.”
||
Gasly wasn’t the only frustrated Alpine driver at the end of a hot race in Austria, with Colapinto also enduring a long afternoon. He was tagged into a spin by Yuki Tsunoda at one point, and then picked up a five-second penalty for forcing Oscar Piastri off the track.
||
“I had the incident with Tsunoda at Turn 4, which set us back a bit and lost us some time,” said Colapinto. ""Yuki came to me and said sorry afterwards, but it's a pity as the car felt different following the contact, potentially due to some damage.""
||
On his moment with Piastri, who was lapping him at the time, Colapinto explained: “He was in my blind spot. After the contact with Tsunoda, I just wanted to pass him and I was not really focused on Oscar.”
||
Alpine remain rooted to the bottom of the Teams' Championship table, 15 points adrift of Kick Sauber, who managed to score with both cars in Austria.

||
Things had initially looked promising for Colapinto, who lined up in P10 on the grid after outqualifying Gasly for the first time since making his F1 comeback. However, after losing a position early on to Kick Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg, the Argentine later lost out further when he found himself in traffic following his first pit stop.
||
It proved to be a difficult race from then onwards for Colapinto and he ultimately crossed the line in 13th, having been unable to work his way back up into the top 10.
||
“I think we maximised what we’ve done today. It just didn’t go our way, I think, strategy-wise,” the 22-year-old reflected after the race. “It was tricky to know [if] we were doing the wrong thing, but I think we definitely were doing the wrong stuff.
||
“At the beginning of the race, stopping early with so many cars starting on [the] hard [tyre], and the team mates of the guys in front making the race slow for them – it just put us in a really bad position, killing the tyres.
||
“I had really slow pace after that pit stop with the dirty air and [it was] very tricky to overtake, just power [limited] on the straights and it just made our race very tricky. We went a bit backwards.
||
“It was tough out there today, I think still [there were] some things learned and some things to take, but we need to focus on the next one.”
||
Despite the disappointing outcome, Colapinto acknowledged that the weekend as a whole had felt like his strongest since making his return to the grid with Alpine in Imola.
||
“Yeah, it feels like that,” he explained. “It’s just that when you start in the points you want to stay there, and it feels like we didn’t do the right things today to try and stay [there], and that’s the only thing.”
||
It was also a challenging day at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve for Gasly. The Frenchman had it all to do after starting from the pit lane – due to changes being made to his car under parc ferme conditions – and a one-stop strategy failed to move him closer towards the points, meaning that he ended the race in P15.
||
“We tried with the strategy – to be fair, we tried everything we could,” Gasly admitted. “[We were] just very slow in the straights, so we need to review exactly what we could have done better.
||
“I think we had some pace, it’s just been a very frustrating afternoon, being stuck behind cars, and unfortunately we’re just slower than them in the straights and it made it very, very tricky to pass, so we’ll review it.”
||
Gasly’s tricky afternoon also saw him forced wide onto the grass by Lance Stroll during a battle for P17, an incident that resulted in the Aston Martin driver receiving a 10-second time penalty.
||
Reflecting on the clash, the 29-year-old said: “We kind of got side-by-side into the last corner. I feel like he could have done a slightly better job to give me a bit more room – not talking about much, I know we’re both at the limit and we’re talking a few centimetres.
||
“But unfortunately it put me in the grass – I had to try to cut the chicane and get back on track. I think bigger picture is just [that it was] a bit of a frustrating afternoon, not being able to race.”

||
Can you describe yourself in three words?
||
Ohhhh. There we go! These type of questions… Okay, I see… I’d say competitive, for sure – that’s the first one that comes to mind. Genuine. And winning! That’s pretty much what drives me.
||

||
What made you fall in love with F1?
||
The speed made me love F1. The adrenaline. I still remember that feeling the first-ever time I jumped in a go-kart, I was six years old on a track back in Normandy near my home. If I close my eyes, even right now, I can just visualise exactly me leaving the pit lane for the first time, going down that straight, going through the grass, because it was the first-ever time, trying to find out my lines and stuff. I just remember that feeling of excitement, fear and adrenaline. It was like a cocktail of emotions. I loved F1 before, like watching on TV, but really that feeling of speed and being so low in the kart from the ground really made me fall in love with it.
||
How many times did it take you to pass your driving test?
||
I passed it the day of my birthday! In France you can pass it… I don’t know if it has changed, but at the time you could only pass it from the moment you turn 18, so I set the appointment on the 7th of February, on my birthday. I think it’s like a half an hour assessment and the guy asked me a couple of questions about F1 for 10 minutes. I was reserve driver back then, and he told me, ‘Okay, well, we’ll skip the rest! You can just go back, you’re fine!’ That was pretty easy. To be fair, the true story is [he was] the dad of a guy I used to race with, and he was like, ‘I know he’s a good driver!’
||
When was the last time you cried with laughter?
||
One of my best friends, we do have a lot of these type of moments. We get to that point a couple of times a week. Probably earlier this week!

BEYOND THE GRID: Pierre Gasly on trusting the Alpine process, his ambitious victory target and life outside F1
||
Who’s your best friend inside the paddock?
||
I’ll go with Charles [Leclerc], because I’ve known him for so many years. Yuki [Tsunoda]… I see Yuki as almost my little brother, who’s turning into a big man now! He’s got big shoes on at the moment. I mean Charles, we’ve known each other, our parents know each other very well… We used to spend amazing time off the track, we used to race together when we were kids, but we’ve [shared] so much special moments [on] the racetrack that it sort of created that genuine and very strong bond between each other.
||
Which three F1 personalities past or present would you invite to a dinner party and why?
||
James Hunt is the first one!
||
His name has come up a lot…
||
Yeah... (Laughs). He’s the type of guy that definitely fully lived his life and probably experienced a lot more than the average F1 driver. Umm… Ayrton Senna, obviously classic, he’s been definitely my idol and someone I’ve looked up to since I was a kid. If I say Senna, I’ve got to go with Alain Prost, but I know Alain and I’ve had the chance to have chats with him and be quite close to him actually, so I’d probably go with [Juan Manuel] Fangio. So, Fangio, James Hunt and Ayrton Senna!

If you had to take a driver to a desert island with you, who would it be and why?
||
I had Kimi Raikkonen that came up in my mind because he won’t talk much so at least we won’t argue! (Laughs). If I had to take another F1 driver, I’d probably go with Charles, because we know each other, so at least it would be more entertaining. Or I’d take Yuki, because he’s got great cooking skills! At least I’ll have my lunch and dinner sorted every now and then.
||
How many languages can you speak? And are there any others you would like to learn?
||
I try to speak one very well, which these days is becoming difficult, because I’m French but I speak more English in my life. I speak French, English, Italian, basic Spanish, like school level Spanish, a few words in Portuguese… I’ll say three quite fluently and two others where I get my way around Spain. I can order beers in Spain and they understand me!
||
What’s your favourite film and TV show of all time?
||
I used to love Harry Potter when I was a kid. It’s like that sort of magic stuff behind it, and it really felt like it took me into a different world, which was quite pleasing. These days, I just get on a series and I love it. Actually, the one on Michael Jordan [The Last Dance], I absolutely loved it, because it was a mix of raw footage from back then with interviews from more recent [times], where he tells more his side of the story that he couldn’t really tell at the time. I’ve been always a big fan of MJ, so probably that series is my favourite.
||
IN TRIBUTE: Pierre Gasly on Ayrton Senna’s multi-generational influence – and how he’s adding to the Brazilian’s legacy
||
What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?
||
The best advice… I’d probably say I remember Jean Alesi, he told me in karting back then just to go step by step. You obviously always dream big and always look very far away in terms of ambitions and where you see yourself, but he was like, ‘Before looking at the outcome and the end goal, be really focused on the present and focused on what’s now. Once that’s done, then it’s the next step and what you’ve got to do to make the best of that next step. Ultimately, you’ll get to the place you want’.
||
I remember this was in Monaco, I was probably 13 years old, and at the time it’s like trying to understand what it means when you’re a kid, but then it sort of all made sense later on. Then just enjoying life. It’s a very simple thing, but we’re always worried about what’s next, what’s next, what’s next? At the end of the day, we’ve got to enjoy what’s happening now and what we’ve got now. I feel like it’s very basic, but it’s very important.
||
Which other job do you wish you could try for a day?
||
Hmm… I’m intrigued with space, or I guess like an astronaut. For a day, you won’t go very far away! I really like my design, interior design and this type of thing, so an interior designer could be one. Playing a Champions League final inside a full, 100,000 [capacity] stadium is definitely something I dreamed of in my life many times! I’d like to be even a Wall Street trader for a day... I think that’s pretty cool, rocking up to your job and just that adrenaline. I think it brings a lot of adrenaline and pressure, and that must be quite a cool feeling!

F1 Correspondent Lawrence Barretto explains the state of play...
||
Well, they're not so much chasing as they are exploring their options.
||
Alpine are in something of a transitional year – and with the Enstone-based team swapping to Mercedes power next year as part of an overhaul of the squad under the stewardship of Flavio Briatore, they are keen to get their driver line-up right for 2026.
||
Pierre Gasly is, without question, part of their plans. Their second seat is trickier.
||
They've already made a change this season, bringing in Franco Colapinto to replace Jack Doohan (with the latter back to reserve and the bench) from Imola onwards.
||
Colapinto hasn't hit the ground running like he did in his super sub performance for Williams and has yet to score a point in five races with the squad.
||
However, it must be said that the car has lacked performance relative to its rivals and, since Colapinto joined the team, his team mate Gasly has scored just once with eighth in Spain.
||
Alpine continue to back Colapinto – and believe he is capable of delivering.
||
But as 2026 edges ever closer, Briatore is doing what you'd expect him to do – keeping his finger on the pulse and ensuring he knows what his options are going forward, hence why sources say he contacted Mercedes to check on Bottas' availability.
||
My understanding is that Mercedes will not stand in Bottas' way should he be offered a race seat elsewhere.
||
I believe Bottas is contracted to the Silver Arrows, where he won all of his 10 races, until the end of the year – and then he is free to make his own decisions with regards trying to find a race seat (or worst-case alternative role) next season.
||
His boss Toto Wolff is a big supporter of Bottas and believes he is still operating at a high-level and is deserving of a place on the grid. So, it's no surprise they would accommodate a request should one be made for his services, especially as Alpine will be running the Silver Arrows' engines next year.
||
It's two-fold. Briatore finds the team's currently level of performance concerning. With Alpine locked to the bottom of the Constructors' Championship, he wants short-term progress soon.
||
Having two strong drivers delivering consistently can have a significant impact – as Williams are seeing with their experienced line-up of Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz.
||
Secondly, he wants the team to take advantage of sweeping changes to the aerodynamic and power unit regulations next season – and the arrival of Mercedes power, which is widely expected to be among the best, if not the best, engines next year.
||
Bringing on someone with Bottas' experience could help on both counts.
||
Teams' standings after Austria
||
The Finn has 247 Grands Prix to his name, has won 10 races, scored 67 podiums and taken 20 pole positions. He excelled during his time at Mercedes, particularly with regards to his one-lap pace, and made a positive impact during his three years at Sauber.
||
His time at Mercedes has given him recent insight into how a race-winning team is operating while he is believed to have been fully plugged into the development of the 2026 car. He even had some seat time with McLaren earlier this year in a 2023-spec car.
||
Alpine could benefit from Bottas' presence in the race team – and there will be those internally who are fans of his given he was in contention for a seat there this year before the management changed and opted for Doohan.
||
One thing is for sure, Bottas is hungry to return to a race seat and more motivated than ever.
||
He took the Mercedes reserve role (to stay relevant, fit and connected to the sport) and is keen on discussions with newcomers Cadillac about a race seat next year.
||
The Finn would back himself to deliver if he gets a shot at Alpine – and you'd expect he'd be interested in a deal that allows him to drive next year, too, for security. His experience with Mercedes power could be invaluable.
||
Such a move would help him get race sharp again so that even if Alpine don't retain him, he would be even more appealing to the likes of Cadillac, as they look to hit the ground running on debut next year.
||
For now, it's business as usual and Colapinto will be in the car at Silverstone and beyond.
||
If Alpine decide they want to pursue an alternative, preliminary talks with Mercedes would likely continue, with Bottas and his management also being drafted in if things accelerate.
||
Absolutely, but every driver is under pressure to perform – and Colapinto is no different.
||
Briatore's move to explore options will raise that pressure, but it might trigger a step up in performance for the Argentine driver.
||
Silverstone is a circuit which the 22-year-old has performed well at in junior formulae – and he'll have fond memories of the place having made his Grand Prix weekend debut there last year when driving for Williams.
||
If Colapinto improves his results, Briatore won't need to change anything for now. And just knowing Bottas is available gives Briatore and Alpine flexibility.
